<p><strong>Asset-backed commercial paper</strong> &mdash; A corporate debt due within a year, and backed by assets such as real estate, autos and other commercial assets.

<p><strong>Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)</strong> &mdash; Debt obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of mortgage loans, most commonly on residential property.
