			<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation administers several programs aimed at strengthening the banking sector.  In an effort to encourage new bank lending and interbank borrowing, the FDIC created the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which has two components. The Transaction Account Guarantee Option guarantees new <a href="{% url glossary %}">senior unsecured debt</a> issued by financial institutions. The Debt Guarantee Option guarantees certain deposits in checking accounts and other <a href="{% url glossary %}">non-interest-bearing accounts</a>.</p>
			
			<p>As a result of a Freedom of Information Act request, Subsidyscope has obtained a list showing <a href="{% media_url %}/data/tlgp_opt_in_source_20090131.csv">which of the more than 14,000 banks, bank holding companies and thrift holding companies in the United States were participating in the TLGP as of Jan. 31, 2009</a>. The document includes the institution's name and location as well as its FDIC or Office of Thrift Supervision identification number and TLGP participation status.</p>

			<p>In addition to the TLGP, the FDIC has temporarily raised the maximum amount of <a href="{% url glossary %}">deposit insurance</a> from $100,000 to $250,000 through 2009.  It also may absorb losses resulting from the federal government's guarantee of Citigroup's assets.</p>
