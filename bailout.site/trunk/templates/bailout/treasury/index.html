			<p>The Treasury Department's efforts have several components. The chart below provides funding levels for each of these programs - both funds released to date and funds authorized to be released in the future. The programs are authorized for different periods of time and receive different level of funding. Because several of these programs include terms that allow the government to receive a return on its investment, it will take time before the precise subsidy cost of each program can be determined.
