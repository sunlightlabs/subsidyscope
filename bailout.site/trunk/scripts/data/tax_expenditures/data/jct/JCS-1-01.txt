    This report \1\ on tax expenditures for fiscal years 2001-
2005 is prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on 
Taxation (``Joint Committee staff '') for the House Committee 
on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance. The 
report also is submitted to the House and Senate Committees on 
the Budget.

    As in the case of earlier reports,\2\ the estimates of tax 
expenditures in this report were prepared in consultation with 
the staff of the Office of Tax Analysis in the Treasury 
Department (``the Treasury''). The Treasury published its 
estimates of tax expenditures for fiscal years 1999-2005 in the 
Administration's budgetary statement of February 2000.\3\ The 
lists of tax expenditures in this Joint Committee staff report 
and the Administration's budgetary statement overlap 
considerably; the differences are discussed in Part I of this 
report under the heading ``Comparisons with Treasury.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Joint Committee staff has made its estimates (as shown 
in Table 1) based on the provisions in tax law as enacted 
through December 31, 2000. Expired or repealed provisions are 
not listed unless they have continuing revenue effects that are 
associated with ongoing taxpayer activity. Proposed extensions 
or modifications of expiring provisions are not included until 
they have been enacted into law.
    Part I of this report contains a discussion of the concept 
of tax expenditures. Part II is a discussion of the measurement 
of tax expenditures. Estimates of tax expenditures for fiscal 
years 2001-2005 are presented in Table 1 in Part III. Table 2 
shows the distribution of tax returns by income class, and 
Table 3 presents distributions of selected individual tax 
expenditures by income class.

                   I. THE CONCEPT OF TAX EXPENDITURES

Overview
    ``Tax expenditures'' are defined under the Congressional 
Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (``the Budget Act'') 
as ``revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Federal 
tax laws which allow a special exclusion, exemption, or 
deduction from gross income or which provide a special credit, 
a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability.'' 
\4\ Thus, tax expenditures include any reductions in income tax 
liabilities that result from special tax provisions or 
regulations that provide tax benefits to particular taxpayers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (P.L. 
93-344), sec. 3(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Special income tax provisions are referred to as tax 
expenditures because they may be considered to be analogous to 
direct outlay programs, and the two can be considered as 
alternative means of accomplishing similar budget policy 
objectives. Tax expenditures are most similar to those direct 
spending programs that have no spending limits, and that are 
available as entitlements to those who meet the statutory 
criteria established for the programs.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ There are a few tax expenditures that have statutorily imposed 
limits. One example is the tax credit for low-income rental housing. 
This credit is available only to those who have received credit 
allocations from State housing authorities. There are statutory limits 
on the total amounts of credit allocations that the States can make 
each year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Estimates of tax expenditures are prepared for use in 
budget analysis. They are a measure of the economic benefits 
that are provided through the tax laws to various groups of 
taxpayers and sectors of the economy. The estimates also may be 
useful in determining the relative merits of achieving 
specified public goals through tax benefits or direct outlays.
    The legislative history of the Budget Act indicates that 
tax expenditures are to be defined with reference to a normal 
income tax structure (referred to here as ``normal income tax 
law''). The determination of whether a provision is a tax 
expenditure is made on the basis of a broad concept of income 
that is larger in scope than ``income'' as defined under 
general U.S. income tax principles.\6\ The Joint Committee 
staff has used its judgment in distinguishing between those 
income tax provisions (and regulations) that can be viewed as a 
part of normal income tax law and those special provisions that 
result in tax expenditures. A provision traditionally has been 
listed as a tax expenditure by the Joint Committee staff if 
there is a reasonable basis for such classification and the 
provision results in more than a de minimis revenue loss, which 
solely for this purpose means a total revenue loss of at least 
$50 million over the five fiscal years 2001-2005. The Joint 
Committee staff emphasizes, however, that in the process of 
listing tax expenditures, no judgment is made, nor any 
implication intended, about the desirability of any special tax 
provision as a matter of public policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ For this reason, the tax expenditure list in Table 1 includes, 
for example, estimates for the net exclusion of pension contributions 
and earnings, the exclusion of extraterritorial income, as well as 
other exclusions, notwithstanding that such exclusions define income 
under the general rule of U.S. income taxation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If a tax expenditure provision were eliminated, Congress 
might choose to continue financial assistance through other 
means rather than terminate all Federal assistance for the 
activity. If a replacement spending program were enacted, the 
higher revenues received as a result of the elimination of a 
tax expenditure might not represent a net budget gain. A 
replacement program could involve direct expenditures, direct 
loans or loan guarantees, regulatory activity, a different form 
of tax expenditure, or a general reduction in tax rates. Joint 
Committee staff estimates of tax expenditures do not anticipate 
such policy responses.
    The Budget Act uses the term tax expenditure to refer to 
the special tax provisions that are contained in the Federal 
income taxes on individuals and corporations.\7\ Other Federal 
taxes such as excise taxes, employment taxes, and estate and 
gift taxes may also have exceptions, exclusions, and credits, 
but those special tax provisions are not included in this 
report because they are not part of the income tax. Thus, for 
example, the income tax exclusion for employer-paid health 
insurance is included, but the Federal Insurance Contributions 
Act (``FICA'') tax exclusion for employer-paid health insurance 
is not treated as a tax expenditure.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ The Federal income tax on individuals also applies to estates 
and trusts, which are subject to a separate income tax rate schedule 
(Internal Revenue Code section 1(e)). Estates and trusts may benefit 
from some of the same tax expenditure provisions that apply to 
individuals. In Table 1 of this report, the tax expenditures that apply 
to estates and trusts have been included in the estimates of tax 
expenditures for individual taxpayers.
    \8\ In its budget statement, the Treasury Department identifies tax 
expenditures in the unified transfer tax (the estate and gift tax and 
the generation-skipping transfer tax). See, Office of Management and 
Budget, ``Tax Expenditures,'' February 7, 2000, pp. 137-139. Other 
analysts have explored applying the concept of tax expenditures to the 
payroll and excise taxes. See, Jonathan Barry Forman, ``Would a Social 
Security Tax Expenditure Budget Make Sense?'' Public Budgeting and 
Financial Management, 5, 1993, pp. 311-335, and Bruce F. Davie, ``Tax 
Expenditures in the Federal Excise Tax System,'' National Tax Journal, 
XLVII, March 1994, pp. 39-62.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Some provisions in the Internal Revenue Code provide for 
special tax treatment that is less favorable than normal income 
tax law. Examples of such provisions include (1) the denial of 
deductions for certain lobbying expenses, (2) the denial of 
deductions for certain executive compensation, and (3) the 2-
percent floor on itemized deductions for unreimbursed employee 
expenses. Tax provisions that provide treatment less favorable 
than normal income tax law are not shown in this report because 
they are not included in the statutory definition of a tax 
expenditure.
Individual Income Tax
    Under the Joint Committee staff methodology, the normal 
structure of the individual income tax includes the following 
major components: one personal exemption for each taxpayer and 
one for each dependent, the standard deduction, the existing 
tax rate schedule, and deductions for investment and employee 
business expenses. Most other tax benefits to individual 
taxpayers can be classified as exceptions to normal income tax 
law.
    Personal exemptions and the standard deduction are treated 
as part of normal income tax law because these amounts 
approximate the level of income below which it would be 
difficult for an individual or a family to obtain minimal 
amounts of food, clothing, and shelter. Those itemized 
deductions that are not necessary for the generation of income 
are classified as tax expenditures, but only to the extent that 
they exceed the standard deduction level.
    Under present law, all employee compensation is subject to 
tax unless the tax code contains a specific exclusion for the 
income. There are specific exclusions for the following 
employer-provided benefits: coverage under accident and health 
plans,\9\ accident and disability insurance, group term life 
insurance, educational assistance, transportation benefits 
(parking, van pools, and transit passes), child care, meals and 
lodging furnished for the convenience of the employer, employee 
awards, and other miscellaneous fringe benefits (e.g., employee 
discounts, services provided to employees at no additional cost 
to employers, tuition reductions, and de minimis fringe 
benefits). Each of these exclusions is classified as a tax 
expenditure in this report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ Present law contains an exclusion for employer-provided 
coverage under accident and health plans (sec. 106 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, the ``Code'') and an exclusion for benefits 
received by employees under employer-provided accident and health plans 
(Code sec. 105(b)). These two exclusions are viewed as a single tax 
expenditure. Under normal income tax law, the value of employer-
provided accident and health coverage would be includable in the income 
of employees, but employees would not be subject to tax on the accident 
and health insurance benefits (reimbursements) that they might receive.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Under normal income tax law, employer contributions to 
pension plans and income earned on pension assets would be 
taxable to employees as the contributions are made and as the 
income is earned, and employees would not receive any deduction 
or exclusion for their pension contributions. Under present 
law, employer contributions to qualified pension plans and 
employee contributions made at the election of the employee 
through salary reduction are not taxed until distributed to the 
employee, and income earned on pension assets is not taxed 
until distributed. The tax expenditure for ``net exclusion of 
pension contributions and earnings'' is computed as the income 
taxes forgone on current tax-excluded pension contributions and 
earnings less the income taxes paid on current pension 
distributions (including the 10-percent additional tax paid on 
early withdrawals from pension plans).
    Under present law, social security retirement benefits are 
fully or partially excluded from gross income.\10\ Under normal 
income tax law, retirees would be entitled to an exclusion for 
only the portion of social security retirement benefits that 
represents a return of the social security taxes that they paid 
during their working years. Thus, the exclusion of social 
security retirement benefits in excess of social security tax 
payments is classified as a tax expenditure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ For taxpayers with modified adjusted gross incomes above 
certain levels, up to 85 percent of social security retirement benefits 
are includable in income.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    All Medicare benefits are excluded from taxation. The value 
of Medicare Part A insurance generally is greater than the 
Health Insurance (``HI'') tax contributions that enrollees made 
during their working years, and the value of Medicare Part B 
insurance generally is greater than the Part B premium that 
enrollees must pay. The exclusion of the value of Medicare Part 
A insurance in excess of HI tax contributions is classified as 
a tax expenditure, and the exclusion of the value of Medicare 
Part B insurance in excess of premiums paid also is classified 
as a tax expenditure.
    Public assistance benefits are excluded from gross income 
by law or by Internal Revenue Service regulations. Table 1 
contains tax expenditure estimates for workers' compensation 
benefits, special benefits for disabled coal miners, and cash 
public assistance benefits (which include Supplemental Security 
Income benefits and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
benefits).
    The individual income tax does not include in gross income 
the imputed income that individuals receive from the services 
provided by owner-occupied homes and durable goods.\11\ 
However, the Joint Committee staff does not classify this 
exclusion as a tax expenditure. The measurement of imputed 
income for tax purposes presents administrative problems and 
its exclusion from taxable income may be regarded as an 
administrative necessity.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ The National Income and Product Accounts include estimates of 
this imputed income. The accounts appear in U.S. Department of 
Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Survey of Current Business, 
published monthly.
    \12\ If the imputed income from owner-occupied homes were included 
in adjusted gross income, it would be proper to include all mortgage 
interest deductions and related property tax deductions as part of the 
normal income tax structure, since interest and property tax deductions 
would be allowable as a cost of producing imputed income. It also would 
be appropriate to allow deductions for depreciation and maintenance 
expenses for owner-occupied homes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Under normal income tax law, individuals would be allowed 
to deduct only the interest on indebtedness incurred in 
connection with a trade or business or an investment. Thus, the 
deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes on a 
principal or second residence are classified as tax 
expenditures.
    The Joint Committee staff assumes that, for administrative 
feasibility, normal income tax law would tax capital gains in 
full in the year the gains are realized through sale or 
exchange. Thus, the deferral of tax until realization is not 
classified as a tax expenditure, but reduced rates of tax, 
further deferrals of tax (beyond the year of sale or exchange), 
and exclusions of certain capital gains are classified as tax 
expenditures.
    It also is assumed that normal income tax law would not 
provide for any indexing of the basis of capital assets for 
changes in the general price level. Thus, under normal income 
tax law (as under present law), the income tax would be levied 
on nominal gains as opposed to real gains in asset values. If, 
as an alternative, normal income tax law were defined to 
include full indexing of the basis of capital assets, the 
capital gains tax expenditure estimates in Table 1 generally 
would be lower than those shown.
    There are many types of State and local government bonds 
and private purpose bonds that qualify for tax-exempt status 
for Federal income tax purposes. Table 1 contains a separate 
tax expenditure listing for each type of bond.
Business Income Taxation
    Regardless of the legal form of organization (sole 
proprietorship, partnership, or S or C corporation), the same 
general principles are used in the computation of taxable 
business income. Thus, most business tax expenditures apply 
equally to unincorporated and incorporated businesses.
    One of the most difficult issues in defining tax 
expenditures for business income relates to the tax treatment 
of capital costs. Under present law, capital costs may be 
recovered under a variety of alternative methods, depending 
upon the nature of the costs and the status of the taxpayer. 
For example, investments in equipment and structures may 
qualify for tax credits, expensing, accelerated depreciation, 
or straight-line depreciation. The Joint Committee staff 
generally classifies as tax expenditures cost recovery 
allowances that are more favorable than those provided under 
the alternative depreciation system (sec. 168(g)), which 
provides for straight-line recovery over tax lives that are 
longer than those permitted under the accelerated system.
    As indicated above, the Joint Committee staff assumes that 
normal income tax law would not provide for any indexing of the 
basis of capital assets. Thus, normal income tax law would not 
take into account the effects of inflation on tax depreciation. 
The expensing and depreciation tax expenditure estimates in 
Table 1 are larger than would be the case if normal income tax 
law provided for inflation adjustments in the basis of assets 
for tax depreciation purposes.
    The Joint Committee staff uses several accounting standards 
in evaluating the provisions in the Code that govern the 
recognition of business receipts and expenses. Under the Joint 
Committee staff view, normal income tax law is assumed to 
require the accrual method of accounting, the standard of 
``economic performance'' (used in the Code to test whether 
liabilities are deductible), and the general concept of 
matching income and expenses. In general, tax provisions that 
do not satisfy all three standards are viewed as tax 
expenditures. For example, the deduction for contributions to 
taxpayer-controlled mining reclamation reserve accounts is 
viewed as a tax expenditure because the contributions do not 
satisfy the economic performance standard. (Adherence to the 
standard would require that the taxpayer make an irrevocable 
contribution toward future reclamation, involving a trust fund 
or similar mechanism, as occurs in a number of areas in the 
Code.) The deduction for contributions to nuclear 
decommissioning trust accounts is not viewed as a tax 
expenditure because the contributions are irrevocable (i.e., 
they satisfy the economic performance standard). However, 
present law provides for a reduced rate of tax on the income of 
nuclear decommissioning trust accounts, and this reduced rate 
of tax is viewed as a tax expenditure.
    The alternative minimum tax (``AMT'') and the passive 
activity loss rules are not viewed by the Joint Committee staff 
as a part of normal income tax law. Instead, they are viewed as 
provisions that reduce the magnitude of the tax expenditures to 
which they apply. For example, the AMT reduces the value of 
business tax credits (for those taxpayers subject to the AMT) 
by not allowing the tax credits to be claimed in the 
calculation of AMT liability. Similarly, the passive loss rules 
defer otherwise allowable deductions and credits from passive 
activities until a time when the taxpayer has passive income or 
disposes of the assets associated with the passive activity. 
Exceptions to the AMT and the passive loss rules are not 
classified as tax expenditures by the Joint Committee staff 
because the effects of the exceptions already are incorporated 
in the estimates of related tax expenditures.
Corporate Income Tax
    The income of corporations (other than S corporations) 
generally is subject to the corporate income tax. The corporate 
income tax includes a graduated tax rate schedule. The lower 
tax rates in the schedule are classified by the Joint Committee 
staff as a tax expenditure (as opposed to normal income tax 
law) because they are intended to provide tax benefits to small 
business and, unlike the graduated individual income tax rates, 
are unrelated to concerns about ability of individuals to pay 
taxes.
    Certain income of pass-through entities is exempt from the 
corporate income tax. The income of sole proprietorships, S 
corporations, and most partnerships is taxed only at the 
individual level. The special tax rules for these pass-through 
entities are not classified as tax expenditures because the tax 
benefits are available to any entity that chooses to organize 
itself and operate in the required manner.
    Nonprofit corporations that satisfy the requirements of 
Code section 501 also generally are exempt from corporate 
income tax. The tax exemption of certain nonprofit cooperative 
business organizations, such as trade associations, is not 
treated as a tax expenditure for the same reason applicable to 
for-profit pass-through business entities. With respect to 
other nonprofit organizations, such as charities, tax-exempt 
status is not classified as a tax expenditure because the 
nonbusiness activities of such organizations generally must 
predominate and their unrelated business activities are subject 
to tax. In general, the imputed income derived from nonbusiness 
activities conducted by individuals or collectively by certain 
nonprofit organizations is outside the normal income tax base. 
However, the ability of donors to such nonprofit organizations 
to claim a charitable contribution deduction is a tax 
expenditure (because such contributions do not generate income 
to the donor), as is the exclusion of income granted to holders 
of tax-exempt financing issued by charities.
Recent Legislation
    The FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 
2000 (H.R. 4986), enacted on November 15, 2000 (P.L. 106-519), 
repealed the Foreign Sales Corporation (``FSC'') provisions and 
enacted an extraterritorial income exclusion, effective for 
transactions after September 30, 2000. The exclusion for 
extraterritorial income is included in the tax expenditure list 
in Table 1.
    The Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 (the 
``Community Renewal Tax Act''),\13\ extended and modified a 
number of tax expenditures, as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ The Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 (H.R. 5662) was 
incorporated by reference in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001, 
which was enacted on December 2, 2000 (P.L. 106-554).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    --Numerous changes were made in the tax rules for 
empowerment zones. The designation of empowerment zone status 
for existing empowerment zones (other than the District of 
Columbia enterprise zone) was extended through December 31, 
2009. The 20-percent wage credit will be made available to all 
existing empowerment zones beginning in 2002, and $35,000 
(rather than $20,000) of additional section 179 expensing will 
be available for qualified zone property placed in service by 
qualified zone businesses in taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 2001. Certain businesses in existing empowerment 
zones (other than the District of Columbia enterprise zone) 
will become eligible for more generous tax-exempt bond rules, 
beginning in 2002. The Secretaries of Housing and Urban 
Development (``HUD'') and Agriculture are authorized to 
designate nine additional empowerment zones, which will be 
eligible for the same tax incentives as existing zones, for the 
period beginning January 1, 2002, and ending on December 31, 
2009. In addition, taxpayers are now permitted to roll over the 
gain from the sale or exchange of qualified empowerment zone 
assets held for more than one year if the proceeds are used to 
purchase other qualified assets in the same zone within 60 
days, effective for sales or exchanges after the date of 
enactment, for assets purchased after the date of enactment. 
And the Act increases to 60 percent (from 50 percent) the 
exclusion of gain from the sale of qualifying small business 
stock held more than five years if the stock also satisfies the 
requirements of a qualifying business under the empowerment 
zone rules, effective for qualifying stock purchased after the 
date of enactment. In Table 1, all of these changes are 
reflected in the tax expenditure estimate for ``empowerment 
zone tax incentives.''
    --The per-capita allocation for the low-income housing 
credit was increased from $1.25 per capita to $1.50 per capita 
in calendar year 2001 and to $1.75 per capita in calendar year 
2002. Beginning in calendar year 2003, the allocation will be 
adjusted annually for inflation. For small States, a minimum 
annual allocation of $2 million will be provided for calendar 
years 2001 and 2002, and beginning in 2003, the small State 
minimum will be adjusted for inflation. Other changes also were 
made to the basic rules for the credit, effective for calendar 
years after 2000.
    --The State volume limits on tax-exempt private activity 
bonds were increased beyond what would have occurred under 
prior law. In calendar year 2001, the volume limit will be the 
greater of $62.50 per resident or $187.5 million. Beginning in 
calendar year 2002, the volume limit will be the greater of $75 
per resident or $225 million, and thereafter the volume limit 
will be adjusted annually for inflation.
    --The expensing of environmental remediation costs, which 
was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2001, was extended 
through December 31, 2003, and the provision was expanded to 
include costs incurred at any site that contains a hazardous 
substance and is certified by the appropriate State agency, 
effective for costs paid or incurred after the date of 
enactment (December 2, 2000).
    --The $5,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers of a 
principal residence in the District of Columbia, which was 
scheduled to expire for residences purchased after December 31, 
2001, was extended through December 31, 2003.
    --The District of Columbia enterprise zone designation, 
which was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2002, was 
extended through December 31, 2003.
    --The enhanced deduction for donations of computer 
technology and equipment, which was scheduled to expire on 
December 31, 2001, was extended through December 31, 2003. The 
deduction also was expanded to include donations to public 
libraries, donations of property reacquired by computer 
manufacturers, and donations of property no later than three 
years (instead of two years) after the date the taxpayer 
acquired or substantially completed the construction of the 
property, with all three changes effective for contributions 
made after December 31, 2000.
    --The deadline for the establishment of new medical savings 
accounts (``MSAs'') was extended from December 31, 2000, to 
December 31, 2002.
    The Community Renewal Tax Act also created two additional 
tax expenditures:
    --The Act authorizes the Secretary of HUD to designate up 
to 40 ``renewal communities'' from areas nominated by States 
and local governments. The areas so designated will be eligible 
for the following tax incentives: (1) a zero-percent rate for 
capital gains from the sale of qualifying assets; (2) a 15-
percent wage credit to employers for the first $10,000 of 
qualified wages; (3) a ``commercial revitalization deduction'' 
that will allow taxpayers to deduct either (a) 50 percent of 
qualifying expenditures for the taxable year in which a 
qualified building is placed in service, or (b) all qualifying 
expenditures ratably over a 10-year period beginning in the 
month in which a qualified building is placed in service; (4) 
an additional $35,000 of section 179 expensing for qualified 
property; and (5) an expansion of the work opportunity tax 
credit with respect to individuals who live in a renewal 
community. These tax benefits generally will be effective 
beginning on January 1, 2002, and will terminate on December 
31, 2009. These tax benefits have been combined into a single 
tax expenditure that is listed in Table 1 as ``renewal 
community tax incentives.''
    --The Act creates a new tax credit for qualified equity 
investments made after December 31, 2000, to acquire stock in a 
community development entity (``CDE''). A CDE is any domestic 
corporation or partnership that has a primary mission of 
serving or providing investment capital to low-income 
communities or low-income persons and satisfies certain other 
requirements. The amount of the credit allowed to an investor 
in a CDE is five percent of the investment for the year in 
which the investment is made, an additional five percent in 
each of the following two years, and six percent in each of the 
following four years. This tax expenditure is listed in Table 1 
as ``new markets tax credit.''
    The Installment Tax Correction Act of 2000 (H.R. 3594), 
enacted on December 28, 2000 (P.L. 106-573), restores the 
option for accrual accounting taxpayers to use the installment 
method of accounting, and thus negates a provision in H.R. 
1180, enacted on December 17, 1999 (P.L. 106-170) that would 
have disallowed the use of the installment method for such 
taxpayers after that date. This increases the tax expenditure 
for ``deferral of gain on non-dealer installment sales.''
Comparisons with Treasury Department
    The Joint Committee staff and Treasury lists of tax 
expenditures differ in two respects. First, the Treasury uses a 
different classification of those provisions that can be 
considered a part of normal income tax law under both the 
individual and business income taxes. In general, the Joint 
Committee staff methodology involves a narrower concept of 
normal income tax law. Thus, the Joint Committee list of tax 
expenditures includes some provisions that are not contained in 
the Treasury list. The cash method of accounting provides an 
example. The Treasury considers the cash accounting option for 
certain businesses to be a part of normal income tax law, but 
the Joint Committee staff methodology treats it as a departure 
from normal income tax law that constitutes a tax expenditure.
    Second, the Joint Committee staff list excludes those 
provisions that are estimated to result in revenue losses below 
the de minimis amount, i.e., less than $50 million over the 
five fiscal years 2001-2005. The Treasury does not have a de 
minimis exception. Thus, the Treasury list of tax expenditures 
includes some provisions that are not contained in the Joint 
Committee staff list.
    The Joint Committee staff and Treasury estimates of tax 
expenditures span slightly different sets of years. The 
Treasury's estimates cover a seven-year period--the last fiscal 
year, the current fiscal year when the President's budget is 
submitted, and the next five fiscal years, i.e., fiscal years 
1999-2005. The Joint Committee staff estimates cover the 
current fiscal year and the succeeding four fiscal years, i.e., 
fiscal years 2001-2005.
    For the past nine years, the President's budget has 
contained a section that reviews and tabulates the estate and 
gift tax provisions that the Treasury considers as tax 
expenditures. The Joint Committee staff considers estate and 
gift tax provisions as being outside of the normal income tax 
structure and thus omits them from its list of tax 
expenditures.
    In some cases, two or more of the tax expenditure items in 
the Treasury list have been combined into a single item in the 
Joint Committee staff list, and vice versa. The Table 1 
descriptions of some tax expenditures also may vary from the 
descriptions used by the Treasury.
    The following is a list of tax expenditure provisions in 
the Joint Committee staff list that are not classified as tax 
expenditures by the Treasury:\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ There are two additional tax expenditure provisions in the 
Joint Committee staff list that are not classified as tax expenditures 
by the Treasury: the expensing of tertiary injectants and the exclusion 
of investment income from structured settlement amounts. These 
provisions are not listed in Table 1 because the estimated revenue 
losses are below the de minimis amount ($50 million over the five 
fiscal years 2001-2005).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Natural resources and environment
--Exclusion of contributions in aid of construction for water 
            and sewer utilities
--Special rules for mining reclamation reserves
--Special tax rate for nuclear decommissioning reserve funds
Agriculture
--Exclusion of cost-sharing payments
--Cash accounting for agriculture
--Five-year carryback period for net operating losses 
            attributable to farming

Insurance companies

--Special treatment of life insurance company reserves
--Deduction of unpaid property loss reserves of property and 
            casualty companies

Business and commerce

--Expensing of magazine circulation expenditures
--Special rules for magazine, paperback book, and record 
            returns
--Completed contract rules
--Cash accounting, other than agriculture
--Deferral of gain on like-kind exchanges
--Exception from net operating loss limitations for 
            corporations in bankruptcy
--Tax credit for employer-paid FICA taxes on tips
--Deferral of gain on involuntary conversions resulting from 
            Presidentially-declared disasters

Employment

--Exclusion of miscellaneous fringe benefits
--Exclusion of employee awards
--Exclusion of income earned by voluntary employee beneficiary 
            associations

Medicare

--Exclusion of untaxed Medicare benefits for Hospital Insurance
--Exclusion of untaxed Medicare benefits for Supplementary 
            Medical Insurance

    The following is a list of the tax expenditure provisions 
that are included in the Treasury list but are excluded from 
the Joint Committee staff list because the estimated revenue 
losses are below the de minimis amount (less than $50 million 
over the five fiscal years 2001-2005):

Energy

--Tax credit for electric vehicles
--Deductions for clean-fuel vehicles and refueling property

Natural resources and environment

--Tax credit and seven-year amortization for reforestation 
            expenditures

Agriculture

--Deferral of tax on gains from the sale of stock in a 
            qualified refiner or processor to an eligible 
            farmer's cooperative

Financial institutions

--Bad debt reserves of financial institutions

Insurance companies

--Special alternative tax on small property and casualty 
            insurance companies
--Tax exemption for insurance companies owned by tax-exempt 
            organizations

Business and commerce

--Ordinary income treatment of losses from sales of small 
            business corporation stock
--Exclusion of income from discharge of indebtedness incurred 
            in connection with qualified real property

Social services

--Expensing of costs for removing architectural barriers

    There are three additional tax expenditure provisions in 
the Treasury list that are not included in the Joint Committee 
staff list. Two of the provisions involve exceptions to the 
passive loss rules: the exception for working interests in oil 
and gas properties, and the exception for up to $25,000 of 
rental losses. The Joint Committee staff does not classify 
these two provisions as tax expenditures; the effects of the 
passive loss rules (and exceptions to the rules) are included 
in the estimates of the tax expenditure provisions that are 
affected by the rules.\15\ The third tax expenditure in the 
Treasury list that is not included in the Joint Committee staff 
list is the exemption of certain income of telephone and 
electric cooperatives. The Joint Committee staff does not 
classify this provision as a tax expenditure because the 
special tax rules for pass-through entities are assumed to be a 
part of normal tax law.\16\

rules, above on page 6.

                  II. MEASUREMENT OF TAX EXPENDITURES

Tax Expenditure Estimates Generally
    A tax expenditure is measured by the difference between tax 
liability under present law and the tax liability that would 
result from a recomputation of tax without benefit of the tax 
expenditure provision. Taxpayer behavior is assumed to remain 
unchanged for tax expenditure estimating purposes.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\ An alternative way to measure tax expenditures is to express 
their values in terms of ``outlay equivalents.'' An outlay equivalent 
is the dollar size of a direct spending program that would provide 
taxpayers with net benefits that would equal what they now receive from 
a tax expenditure. The Treasury Department presents estimates of outlay 
equivalents in the President's budget in addition to presenting 
estimates in the same manner as the Joint Committee staff.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The tax expenditure estimates in this report are based on 
Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee staff 
projections of the gross income, deductions, and expenditures 
of individuals and corporations for calendar years 2000-2005. 
These projections are used to compute tax liabilities for the 
present-law revenue baseline and tax liabilities for the 
alternative baseline that assumes that the tax expenditure 
provision does not exist.
    Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') statistics from recent 
tax returns are used to develop projections of the tax credits, 
deductions, and exclusions that will be claimed under the 
present-law baseline. These IRS statistics show the actual 
usage of the various tax expenditure provisions. In the case of 
some tax expenditures, such as the earned income tax credit, 
there is evidence that some taxpayers are not claiming all of 
the benefits to which they are entitled, while others are 
filing claims that exceed their entitlements. The tax 
expenditure estimates in this report are based on projections 
of actual claims under the various tax provisions, not the tax 
benefits to which taxpayers are entitled.
    Some tax expenditure estimates are based partly on 
statistics for income, deductions, and expenses for prior 
years. Accelerated depreciation is an example. Estimates for 
this tax expenditure are based on the difference between tax 
depreciation deductions under present law and the deductions 
that would have been claimed in the current year if investments 
in the current year and all prior years had been depreciated 
using the alternative (normal income tax law) depreciation 
system.
    Each tax expenditure is estimated separately, under the 
assumption that all other tax expenditures remain in the tax 
code. If two or more tax expenditures were estimated 
simultaneously, the total change in tax liability could be 
smaller or larger than the sum of the amounts shown for each 
item separately, as a result of interactions among the tax 
expenditure provisions.
    Year-to-year differences in the estimates for each tax 
expenditure reflect changes in tax law, including phaseouts of 
tax expenditure provisions and changes that alter the 
definition of the normal income tax structure, such as the tax 
rate schedule, the personal exemption amount, and the standard 
deduction. Some of the estimates for this tax expenditure 
report may differ from estimates made in previous years because 
of changes in law and economic conditions, the availability of 
better data, and improved estimating techniques.
Tax Expenditures versus Revenue Estimates
    A tax expenditure estimate is not the same as a revenue 
estimate for the repeal of the tax expenditure provision for 
two reasons. First, tax expenditure estimates do not 
incorporate any changes in taxpayer behavior, whereas revenue 
estimates incorporate the effects of the behavioral changes 
that are anticipated to occur in response to the repeal of a 
tax provision. Second, tax expenditure estimates are concerned 
with changes in the tax liabilities of taxpayers. Because the 
tax expenditure focus is on tax liabilities as opposed to 
Federal government tax receipts, there is no concern for the 
timing of tax payments. Revenue estimates are concerned with 
changes in Federal tax receipts, which are affected by the 
timing of tax payments.
    If a tax expenditure provision were repealed, it is likely 
that the repeal would be made effective at the beginning of a 
calendar year. In this case, the revenue estimate for repeal 
would show a smaller revenue gain in the first fiscal year than 
in subsequent years, because the repeal would be occurring 
after the start of the government's fiscal year. The revenue 
estimate might also reflect some delay in the timing of the 
revenue gains as a result of the taxpayer tendency to postpone 
or forgo changes in tax withholding and estimated tax payments.

                     III. TAX EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES

    Tax expenditures are grouped in Table 1 in the same 
functional categories as outlays in the Federal budget. 
Estimates are shown separately for individuals and 
corporations. Those tax expenditures that do not fit clearly 
into any single budget category have been placed in the most 
appropriate category.
    Several of the tax expenditure items involve small amounts 
of revenue, and those estimates are indicated in Table 1 by 
footnote 1. For each of these items, the footnote means that 
the tax expenditure is less than $50 million in the fiscal 
year.
    Table 2 presents tax return information for each of nine 
income classes on the number of all returns (including filing 
and nonfiling units), the number of taxable returns, the number 
of returns with itemized deductions, and the amount of tax 
liability.
    Table 3 provides distributional estimates by income class 
for some of the tax expenditures that affect individual 
taxpayers. Not all tax expenditures that affect individuals are 
shown in this table because of the difficulty in making 
reliable estimates of the income distribution of items that do 
not appear on tax returns under present law.
