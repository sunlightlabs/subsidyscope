"#","Accelerated depreciation on rental housing (normal tax method)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Accelerated depreciation of residential rental property.&mdash;Under an economic income tax, the costs of acquiring a building are capitalized and depreciated over time in accordance with the decline in the propertys economic value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This insures that the net income from the rental property is measured appropriately each year. However, the depreciation provisions of the Tax Code are part of the reference law rules, and thus do not give rise to tax expenditures under reference law. Under normal law, however, depreciation allowances reflect estimates of economic depreciation. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/spec.pdf""><em>Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2011</em>.</a>"
