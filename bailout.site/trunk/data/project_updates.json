On Oct. 14, 2008, Treasury announced in <a href=\"http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/reports/termsheet.pdf\">the program term sheet</a> that the strike price would be based on the average price of a company's shares over 20 days prior to the time of issuance &mdash; the date the transaction was <em>closed</em>. In fact, contracts show that the strike price was based on the 20-day period prior to the date the company <em>applied</em> for TARP funds &mdash; a difference of weeks in many cases. Many stocks declined in value during that time, meaning that the government often paid more for the warrants under the revised terms. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy affects only a small portion of the overall subsidies associated with TARP and has no impact on the <a href=\"/projects/bailout/tarp/subsidies/\">subsidy estimates</a> presented on the Subsidyscope Web site since the estimates are based on the actual strike prices used in the contracts.
