Bass is the founder and executive director of OMB Watch, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization\r\nwhich promotes greater government accountability and transparency and increased citizen participation in public policy decisions. In 2003, he created <a\r\nhref=\"http://www.npaction.org/\">NPAction</a> as a one-stop website on building nonprofit advocacy. He is also a co-author of the 2007 book <a\r\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Seen-but-not-Heard-Strengthening/dp/B001BX8EM6\"><em>Seen but not Heard: Strengthening Nonprofit Advocacy</em></a>, published by the Aspen Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>In 2006, he successfully championed passage of a law that required the government to create a searchable website providing information about government spending. At the same time,\r\nOMB Watch launched <a href=\"http://www.fedspending.org/\">FedSpending.org</a>, which has proven invaluable to journalists, public interest organizations and citizens looking for\r\ninformation on more than $16.8 trillion in government spending \u2014 and serves as a model for how the government should implement its requirements to create a searchable website.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>In addition to his role at OMB Watch, Dr. Bass is an affiliated associate professor at Georgetown University&#8217;s Public Policy Institute and also teaches in the Nonprofit\r\nManagement Executive Certificate program at Georgetown&#8217;s Center for Public and Nonprofit Leadership. He has served on numerous boards and has been an advisor to many organizations\r\nincluding the Advocacy Evaluation Project at Innovation Network, Center for Lobbying in the Public Interest, Coalition on Human Needs, Hampshire Research Institute, Loka Institute,\r\nNational Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, OpentheGovernment.org, the Science and Environment Health Network, and the Center on Government Secrecy at American University&#8217;s\r\nWashington College of Law.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Prior to founding OMB Watch, Dr. Bass was president of the Human Services Information Center where he wrote two books and numerous articles on human services issues and published the\r\nHuman Services INSIDER, a bimonthly newsletter on the politics of federal human services programs.

Together, these acquisitions allow the center to produce some of the most sophisticated calculations done anywhere in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>In addition to acquiring analytical models, Beach helps build them. He was instrumental in developing the state-of-the-art econometric models Heritage uses to estimate in detail\r\nhow<br /> proposed tax changes will likely affect individuals, families, and various business sectors-as well as the overall national economy. Indeed, the center has become the leading\r\nproponent of dynamic scoring, which shows how much federal revenues change when the U.S. economy reacts to a tax increase or a tax cut.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Under Beach&#8217;s direction, the center has progressed to the point that it regularly competes with the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, the Joint\r\nCommittee on Taxation, or any other government agency when it comes to &#8220;scoring&#8221; potential costs and benefits of legislation. Indeed, federal lawmakers often ask the center\r\nto analyze legislation they have drafted, knowing they can get a reliable estimate more quickly from the CDA than from any Capitol Hill agency.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Prior to joining Heritage in 1995, Beach held a variety of posts in the public, private and academic sectors. He served as a litigation economist with two Kansas City, Mo., law\r\nfirms-Campbell & Bysfield and Watson, Ess, Marshall &amp; Enggas &ndash; where he specialized in analyzing how anti-trust legal remedies would alter product pricing and availability.\r\nLater, as an economist for Missouri&#8217;s Office of Budget and Planning, he designed and managed the state&#8217;s econometric model and advised the governor on revenue and economic\r\nissues. After a stint in the corporate headquarters of Sprint United Inc., Beach moved to the Washington, D.C., area to serve as president of the Institute for Humane Studies at George\r\nMason University.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>A graduate of Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., Beach also holds a master&#8217;s degree in history and economics from the University of Missouri-Columbia.

Subsidyscope, an initiative of Pew's Economic Policy Department, will aggregate information on subsidies from multiple sources into a comprehensive, searchable, open-source database, which will serve as a gateway for press, policymakers, advocates and the public. The project will be guided by a broad and bipartisan advisory board of budget, fiscal and transparency experts. The Subsidyscope board met in Washington today to launch the project.\r\n\r\n\"The current financial crisis has led to historic market interventions by the federal government and has invigorated the national debate about the appropriate role of government in the economy,\" said John E. Morton, managing director of Pew's Economic Policy Department.  \"Too often policymakers speak as if subsidies are limited to direct expenditures on assorted social programs. The reality is that increasingly they flow through the tax code and are not subject to the same level of public oversight. In our fiscally constrained environment\u2014and with government interventions shifting new burdens onto American taxpayers\u2014there is more need than ever for a comprehensive and transparent fact base to inform future discussions about subsidies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Federal subsidies go well beyond direct payments from the federal government to private businesses,\" said Douglas Hamilton, deputy director of Pew's Economic Policy Department. \"They also include tax breaks for individuals and corporations, loan guarantees, stock purchases and other financial interventions.  And they're massive. By some accounts, the tax breaks for individuals alone cost hundreds of billions of dollars a year.\"\r\n\r\nPew will work closely with representatives of partner organizations to call attention to the study of subsidies, both in the project, but also through the work of contributing organizations.\r\n\r\n\"By working together, we believe that we can improve the definition of what constitutes subsidies, and highlight the full extent of their reach in the market,\" said Morton. \"In this phase of the project, we won't take a position on whether certain subsidies are better than others \u2013 we want to move the facts into the public arena. We hope the data are used by advocates on all sides of the issue.\"  \r\n\r\nPew has engaged the Sunlight Foundation, a national leader on matters of government transparency, as its research and technology partner on the project.  Sunlight will be responsible for constructing the technical infrastructure, compiling data and building Subsidyscope's database.  \r\n\r\n\"This project represents an exciting opportunity to shine a light on various ways that increasingly scarce federal resources are being spent,\" said Ellen Miller, the Sunlight Foundation's co-founder and executive director. \"While we don't know precisely what the project will find, as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously said, 'Sunlight is the best disinfectant.'\"\r\n\r\nDuring the course of developing the database, Subsidyscope will release regular reports, aggregating and analyzing subsidies to various industry sectors.  \r\n\r\n\\###\r\n\r\nThe [Pew Charitable Trusts](http://www.pewtrusts.org) is driven by the power of knowledge to solve today's most challenging problems.
