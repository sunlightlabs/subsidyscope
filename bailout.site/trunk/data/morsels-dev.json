A number of attempts at geographic analysis, including the recent launch of the Treasury Department's <a href=\"http://financialstability.gov/impact/index.html\">Local Impact map</a>, have largely failed to recognize the complexity of the financial industry and do not paint a complete picture of the geography of funds distributed.

Subsidyscope has gathered data on each transaction under the TARP program. The following table shows which companies received funds, how much they received, and when they received it.  Detailed data on individual transactions can be downloaded into a spreadsheet, and the visualizations provide a quick view of the transactions over time, by recipient and by date.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Although the government has provided a few companies with loans under TARP, nearly all the transactions have been purchases of equity stakes in those companies.  In exchange for funding from TARP, the government usually receives preferred stock and warrants from the company.

But it is not a measure of the subsidy itself.  To calculate the subsidies, the market value of the preferred stock, warrants, and loans must be deducted from the funding provided to the institution.

Institutions make dividend payments on a quarterly basis at a rate of at least 5 percent of their annual profits; the rate ultimately will increase to 9 percent. The Subsidyscope transaction database reflects the payments made by participants in TARP initiatives such as the Capital Purchase Program. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said that the department intends to make dividend data public on a monthly basis. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financial institutions can repay TARP funds only with the approval of the Treasury Department and their federal banking regulator, the regulator having the final say. Banks that wish to repay TARP funds must prove that they have adequate capital to continue lending to creditworthy borrowers.

New rules regarding executive compensation, which can be found in <a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h1enr.pdf\">Title VII, Section 7001(g) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a>, have allowed  many financial institutions to repay because the restrictions were not in the original contracts.

Fifteen more banks have failed since March 31, leading to estimated charges of $8.3 billion against the fund. <a href=\"/projects/bailout/fdic/bank-failures/table/\">View or download a list of failed banks and their charges against the fund here</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/1000-150.html\">By law</a>, a review is required whenever the fund incurs a \"material loss\" from an institution placed in FDIC receivership. To reach that threshold, the loss must exceed the greater of $25 million or 2 percent of an institution's total assets. The review must be carried out by the inspector general of the institution's regulator within six months of the failure.

History shows that support from the Treasury can be important. In the 1980s, the fund that insured deposits in savings and loans became insolvent, a victim of a thrift crisis that, by some estimates, cost taxpayers about $125 billion. The fund was abolished in 1989.

Most commonly, agencies will seek comments for proposed rules at least 30 days before they publish the proposal in the <i>Federal Register</i> \u2013 the daily official publication of federal rules, proposed rules and notices. Agencies take the comments into consideration before passing a final rule that will ultimately appear in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. Final rules can also be amended using the same process.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut the case of the Legacy Loans Program, one arm of the Treasury Department's newly-announced Public-Private Investment Program, is unusual. The program was created under an emergency provision in the FDIC charter that allows the Treasury secretary to determine whether there is a systemic risk to the economy. Using the provision, the FDIC can take action to avoid or mitigate systemic risk. So while the FDIC isn't bound to hold a comment process, the agency has chosen to do so to hear from the public on the program.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Legacy Loans Program</b>\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Legacy Loans Program is aimed at getting rid of troubled assets and loans held by banks across the country. The market for many troubled assets, the root of the current economic crisis, has collapsed and the value of those assets has fallen sharply. The Treasury Department and the FDIC created the Public-Private Investment Program to rebuild that market, which would allow banks to sell those assets, free up capital and increase lending.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe government explored the option of purchasing the troubled assets directly, but officials felt that any price set would be too high. Instead, under the $500 billion to $1 trillion Legacy Loans Program, Treasury will partner with private investors by creating joint Public-Private Investment Funds that will pay for the troubled assets.\r\n</p><p>\r\nUnder the program, the Public-Private Investment Funds would purchase troubled assets from the banks with financing from the Treasury, private investors and the FDIC.  The Treasury Department and private investors would contribute equal amounts of equity financing; the rest of the financing would come from debt that was guaranteed by the FDIC.  The debt guaranteed by the FDIC will be determined by the assets themselves, but it cannot exceed 6 times the amount of equity contributed by the Treasury and private investors.  The FDIC would charge the funds a fee for the guarantee.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPotential investors in the funds may include a wide range of institutions, including mutual funds, pension plans, insurance companies, financial institutions, individuals, publicly managed investment funds, private equity funds, hedge funds and other long-term investors.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIf a fund turns a profit, its returns are split equally between private investors and the government. However, if a fund loses money, the loss is first absorbed by the equity contributed by the Treasury and the private investors, and if those contributions are insufficient to cover the loss, the remainder is absorbed by the FDIC. Although private investors fully share the potential profit gains with the government, any losses are only limited to their initial equity contribution. The government bears most of the downside risk.\r\n</p><p>\r\nProponents of the funds argue that the participation of private investors will help restart the market for troubled assets and help reveal the true prices of those assets.  Critics, however, note that because private investors bear little downside risk, the funds will end up paying too much for those troubled assets.

In its request, it outlined 17 questions, relating to everything from what type of asset should be sold, to whether the identities of participating investors should be made public.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRespondents suggested changes. Some drew diagrams. There were rants, and there were displays of gratitude, and cautiousness. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\"We are grateful for the opportunity to comment on this program and look forward to helping the LLP be successful and beneficial for taxpayers, our communities, the federal government and the banking industry,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp270.pdf\">Joe Brannen</a>, the President and CEO of the Georgia Bankers Association, which represents more than 350 commercial banks and thrifts.\r\n</p><p> \r\n\"In our view, this could be an important tool for removing troubled loans that are prevent some of our member banks from supporting new lending in communities throughout Georgia.\"\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn contrast, a blogger known as <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp391.pdf\">Dr. Housing Bubble</a> cautioned the FDIC not to go through with the program.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\"You are the absolute last line of defense from giving out a massive $500 billion to $1 trillion in handouts to perpetrators of this financial crisis\u2026 the program is marketed as a public and private partnership, but the massive downside potential is falling on the shoulders of the taxpayers,\" the blogger wrote. \"In the end, taxpayers are fronting nearly 93 percent of the risk\u2026 When these loans start failing, as they will, the FDIC will suddenly become one of the biggest toxic mortgage holders... It is a recipe for another disaster.\"\r\n</p><p>\r\nOther comments offered tacit approval but cautioned the FDIC to tread carefully. <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp418.pdf\">Mark J. Tenhundfeld</a>, director of regulatory policy at the American Bankers Association, said that his organization was concerned about the FDIC's \"mission creep.\"\r\n</p><p>\r\n\"The FDIC must not allow itself to become extended in activities beyond its traditional role of deposit insurer that in any way detract from\u2026 its primary and paramount deposit insurance responsibilities,\" Tenhundfeld wrote.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTenhundfeld also recommended that banks be allowed to purchase pooled troubled assets of other banks to increase the number of bidders and the chance that such assets would be sold.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBank of America's deputy general counsel, <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp219.pdf\">Gregory A. Baer</a>, asked that the FDIC assure private investors that \"once the core terms of the program are established, neither the FDIC nor the government bodies will engage in undue efforts to change the terms of the program. The financial community has witnessed punitive modifications to other government programs after they had been established, creating uncertainty and discouraging participation.\"\r\n</p><p>\r\nBaer also asked for the auctioned assets to include corporate loans, construction loans and revolving credit facilities \u2013 and not just real estate assets.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn contrast, a non-profit organization, the <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp132.pdf\">Center for Responsible Lending</a>, recommended that the assets only include residential real estate assets, which are the source of the crisis.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe center also asked the FDIC to include President Obama's Home Affordable Modification Program, which expands the eligibility of home borrowers, in the Legacy Loans Program. It recommended that all loans and related assets sold or acquired through the LLP be subject to HAMP, and all institutions that sell loans or other assets through the program be required to participate in HAMP.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>The Question of Transparency</b>\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne of the FDIC's questions to commenters was whether they thought investors' identities should be made publicly available. The responses were varied.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Center for Responsible Lending said that transparency was essential \"to ensure that homeowners can identify the ultimate owners of their mortgage loans, and that policymakers and independent analysts can meaningfully evaluate participants' performance under the Program.\"\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp352.pdf\">Richard Keck</a>, a partner at the Duane Morris law firm, which represents the Flat Earth Capital private equity investment firm, said that investors' names should be held in confidence by the government.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\"Investors typically have expectations of privacy in their investment decisions,\" Keck wrote. \"Requiring them to forfeit those privacy interests as a condition to investing in the PPIFs is likely to discourage some investors and make it more difficult and costly to raise the necessary private equity.\"\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp355.pdf\">Ryan Bybee</a>, a representative of the DBS private equity fund, said it didn't matter if their name was made public.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\"No big deal, just don't demonize us if we make a buck or two, we are partners in this deal and we perform a necessary service for the public,\" Bybee wrote.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp252.pdf\">Michael Hrebenar</a>, president and CEO of NC Ventures in Stafford, Texas, said that making investors' information public could actually raise their profile.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\"In fact, investors may receive new contacts from parties that read such publication (we have received numerous calls lately from businesses that saw our name on the Purchaser list), which may provide new business opportunities, which in turn would help the economy,\" Hrebenar wrote.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe FDIC will consider these and all other comments as it writes its final rule for the troubled asset auctions. While the FDIC isn't saying when the first of these auctions will take place, it could happen in the next few months.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{% endglossarize %}", "locked": 0, "page": 6, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 16, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "{% load glossary_tags %}\r\n\r\n{% glossarize %}\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal Reserve has engaged in a broad range of activities to try to improve the economy.

Because the banks believe these losses are temporary, they don\u2019t have to be recognized on the banks\u2019 accounting statements. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nWhat\u2019s potentially worrisome is the sheer size of the losses. For the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle, they are substantially larger than the capital the bank holds to protect itself against such declines.

The system works as a cooperative: there are 12 regional banks, and they serve their members \u2013 8,100 commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, and insurance companies across the country. The FHLBs can borrow cheaply because investors believe that, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government won't let them fail. The home loan banks are especially helpful to community banks and small thrifts because these smaller institutions typically find it more difficult to raise capital themselves. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe troubles began when several FHLBs invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities created by Wall Street.   As the housing crisis developed, these investments lost a good deal of their value.  A Subsidyscope review of the banks' annual reports found that in the first three months of 2009 alone, several FHLBs saw the ratings of a large portion of these securities decline from AAA to junk status, most notably the Boston, San Francisco and Seattle banks. A downgrade to junk doesn\u2019t mean the securities are worthless, and an improvement in the market could increase their value. Still, the downgrades were numerous. The San Francisco bank, for example, saw $7 billion of its private mortgage-backed securities go to junk (see graphic below).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Article continues after graphic)</p>", "locked": 0, "page": 8, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 28, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p><strong>April 28, 2009 - TARP Estimates Sharply Higher</strong> <br>CBO Director Doug Elmendorf <a href=\"http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=231\">recently highlighted in a blog post </a>that the agency sharply increased its estimates of the projected subsidies provided by the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to $356 billion, up from the January estimate of $189 billion.

Those actions have raised many citizens\u2019 awareness of the role of subsidies in the economy and heightened concerns about their size, not only in the financial sector, but in other sectors as well. Yet, despite growing public concerns, comprehensive and high-quality information about the true scale of government subsidies is still lacking.

In 2003, he created <a\r\nhref=\"http://www.npaction.org/\">NPAction</a> as a one-stop website on building nonprofit advocacy. He is also a co-author of the 2007 book <a\r\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Seen-but-not-Heard-Strengthening/dp/B001BX8EM6\"><em>Seen but not Heard: Strengthening Nonprofit Advocacy</em></a>, published by the Aspen Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>In 2006, he successfully championed passage of a law that required the government to create a searchable website providing information about government spending. At the same time,\r\nOMB Watch launched <a href=\"http://www.fedspending.org/\">FedSpending.org</a>, which has proven invaluable to journalists, public interest organizations and citizens looking for\r\ninformation on more than $16.8 trillion in government spending \u2014 and serves as a model for how the government should implement its requirements to create a searchable website.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>In addition to his role at OMB Watch, Dr. Bass is an affiliated associate professor at Georgetown University&#8217;s Public Policy Institute and also teaches in the Nonprofit\r\nManagement Executive Certificate program at Georgetown&#8217;s Center for Public and Nonprofit Leadership. He has served on numerous boards and has been an advisor to many organizations\r\nincluding the Advocacy Evaluation Project at Innovation Network, Center for Lobbying in the Public Interest, Coalition on Human Needs, Hampshire Research Institute, Loka Institute,\r\nNational Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, OpentheGovernment.org, the Science and Environment Health Network, and the Center on Government Secrecy at American University&#8217;s\r\nWashington College of Law.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Prior to founding OMB Watch, Dr. Bass was president of the Human Services Information Center where he wrote two books and numerous articles on human services issues and published the\r\nHuman Services INSIDER, a bimonthly newsletter on the politics of federal human services programs. He also served as director of liaison for the International Year of Disabled Persons;\r\nworked as a consultant on several projects in special education and the mental health of children and youth, most notably the preparation of the first annual report to Congress on the\r\nimplementation of the Education of All Handicapped Children Act (P.L. 94-142), now called the Individuals with Disability Education Act; and served as special assistant to Wilbur Cohen,\r\nthen chair of the Michigan Governor&#8217;s Task Force on the Investigation and Prevention of Abuse in Residential Institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Dr. Bass received a combined doctorate in psychology and education from The University of Michigan, along with the University&#8217;s highest award for graduate student teaching and\r\nseveral awards for academic excellence.</p> </li> <li> <a name=\"williambeach\"></a><h4 class=\"bio_head\">William Beach </h4> <p>As Director of The Heritage Foundation&#8217;s Center for Data Analysis, William Beach\r\nis the think tank&#8217;s chief &#8220;number cruncher&#8221;: He oversees Heritage&#8217;s original statistical research on taxes, Social Security, crime, education, trade and a host of\r\nother issues, ensuring it&#8217;s both rigorous in its technical scholarship and produced in time to help inform the public debate over the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Under Beach&#8217;s leadership, Heritage has acquired one of the largest privately-held public-policy databases in the United States, as well as a variety of peer-reviewed analytical\r\nmodels. Together, these acquisitions allow the center to produce some of the most sophisticated calculations done anywhere in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>In addition to acquiring analytical models, Beach helps build them. He was instrumental in developing the state-of-the-art econometric models Heritage uses to estimate in detail\r\nhow proposed tax changes will likely affect individuals, families, and various business sectors-as well as the overall national economy. Indeed, the center has become the leading\r\nproponent of dynamic scoring, which shows how much federal revenues change when the U.S. economy reacts to a tax increase or a tax cut.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Under Beach&#8217;s direction, the center has progressed to the point that it regularly competes with the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, the Joint\r\nCommittee on Taxation, or any other government agency when it comes to &#8220;scoring&#8221; potential costs and benefits of legislation. Indeed, federal lawmakers often ask the center\r\nto analyze legislation they have drafted, knowing they can get a reliable estimate more quickly from the CDA than from any Capitol Hill agency.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Prior to joining Heritage in 1995, Beach held a variety of posts in the public, private and academic sectors. He served as a litigation economist with two Kansas City, Mo., law\r\nfirms-Campbell & Bysfield and Watson, Ess, Marshall &amp; Enggas &ndash; where he specialized in analyzing how anti-trust legal remedies would alter product pricing and availability.\r\nLater, as an economist for Missouri&#8217;s Office of Budget and Planning, he designed and managed the state&#8217;s econometric model and advised the governor on revenue and economic\r\nissues. After a stint in the corporate headquarters of Sprint United Inc., Beach moved to the Washington, D.C., area to serve as president of the Institute for Humane Studies at George\r\nMason University.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>A graduate of Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., Beach also holds a master&#8217;s degree in history and economics from the University of Missouri-Columbia.

The Treasury provides headquarters locations for the recipient institutions in the CPP information on its Web site, which is an attractive and readily accessible geographic indicator. However, using a bank's headquarters to map its reach is of questionable utility given that many financial institutions affect communities well outside of the state in which their headquarters is located. Unfortunately, many of the available maps rely solely on this indicator, including Treasury's Local Impact map.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A closer look at the Treasury map demonstrates the shortcomings of this approach. States with large financial centers are shown receiving a majority share of CPP funds while states without a significant banking presence receive little or no funds. For example, the entire state of Arizona is shown as having received only $2.5 million in CPP funds; Montana is shown as having received nothing. The lack of bank headquarters in these states may indicate an unequal distribution of funds under CPP; however, the high degree of disparity shown in Treasury's map is suspect. In reality, banks that have received TARP funds \u2014 although headquartered in other states \u2014 do engage in significant business in Arizona and Montana, a relationship not reflected in this map. As a result, this map and others use bank headquarters locations as an impact metric present a misleading representation of CPP funds distribution.*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While no mapping technique can perfectly capture the flows of money provided by the bailout,  Subsidyscope's alternative methodology uses government data sets to illustrate the geography of bank branch locations, deposits and lending activity. These three metrics for measuring the geography of banking activity offer a means for estimating the share of activity for a given bank within a specific region. We use the county (or county equivalent) as the core unit of geography though the underlying data could be interpreted at other levels of specificity (e.g. state or census tract). We also combine data for all organizations within a given ownership hierarchy such that the geography of subsidiary banking activity is reflected in the data for bank holding companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to calculate TARP impact using bank branches and deposits we collected a complete copy of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Summary of Deposits database (as of June 2008). This database tracks branch locations and deposits for all FDIC member banks as well as institutions regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision. From this data we determine the share of activity for a given location on an institution-by-institution basis or in aggregate for all TARP recipients. As might be expected, there is a strong correlation between branch locations and deposit shares; however, we provide both metrics for completeness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, we use data on home loan originations from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database from 2007 to track lending activity for a given institution. This data is merged using the Federal Reserve's Organizational Hierarchy database for HMDA reporting institutions. The geography of mortgage lending differs substantially from branch/deposit geography as many banks accept loan applications online or through local mortgage brokers. For example, Citigroup, which operates very few bank branches nationwide, issues loans in nearly every county through brokerage and online sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To download the data powering this visualization use the link below.

The maximum lending amount under this program is <a href=\"http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9957/01-07-Outlook.pdf\">$600 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Money Market Investor Funding Facility</strong>, created in October 2008, will buy certificates of deposit and commercial paper from money market mutual funds. This facility has yet to be utilized as of March 2009, but could make purchases up to <a href=\"http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9957/01-07-Outlook.pdf\">$540 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These lending facilities have significantly changed the way that the Fed operates. Generally speaking, before the onset of the financial crisis, a typical Fed loan had a  term ranging from <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_table1popup.htm#6\">overnight to 14 days</a>. With the new lending facilities, the terms of loans can be as long as <a href=\"http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/talf_terms.html\">three years</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As the economy improves, the Fed plans to phase out most of the programs used to acquire assets and return to its historical mission of keeping credit flowing between banks by setting the interest rate at which they lend to one another. The size of the Fed is likely to shrink drastically: as of <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current/\">March 26, 2009</a>, it holds assets worth more than $2 trillion; traditionally, it has held about <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20070621/\">$850 billion</a>. Although the Fed should be able to reduce its holdings of short-term securities quickly, questions have been raised about how quickly the Fed will be able to reduce its portfolio of longer-term securities.</p>\n\n<p>Other key programs include:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"with-bullets\">\n\t<li>The <a href=\"/projects/bailout/glossary/#tslf\">Term Securities Lending Facility</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"/projects/bailout/glossary/#credit-extended-to-aig\">Credit extended to AIG</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"/projects/bailout/glossary/#asset-backed-commercial-paper\">Asset-backed Commercial Paper</a> Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (<a href=\"/projects/bailout/glossary/#amlf\">AMLF</a>):</li> \n\t<li>Primary dealer and other broker credit facility</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"/projects/bailout/glossary/#federal-agency-debt-security\">Federal agency debt securities</a></li>\n\t<li>Net Portfolio holdings of <a href=\"/projects/bailout/glossary/#maiden-lane-i\">Maiden Lane LLC</a></li>\n\t<li>Net portfolio holdings of <a href=\"/projects/bailout/glossary/#maiden-lane-ii\">Maiden Lane II LLC</a></li>\n\t<li>Net portfolio holdings of <a href=\"/projects/bailout/glossary/#maiden-lane-iii\">Maiden lane III LLC</a></li>\n\t<li>Currency swaps</li>\n</ul>\n\n", "locked": 0, "page": 7, "name": "text2"}}, {"pk": 22, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p>Over the past week, new financial reports have come out that confirm trouble at the Federal Home Loan Banks -- and the biggest news comes from the Seattle bank.

Under the contract, the government will make money on the warrants only if the BAC's stock price exceeds $30.79.  Under the policy articulated by the press releases and term sheets, the government would have made money on the warrants once the stock price exceeded $25.94.  By setting a higher strike price, the government provides a larger subsidy to BAC.  However, given today's price for BAC stock (which was only $3.14 on March 6, 2009), the warrants have very little value regardless of the strike price.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Inconsistencies in the Treasury Department's description of the warrant program do not affect any of the subsidy estimates prepared by governmental organizations such as the Congressional Budget Office or the Congressional Oversight Panel, nor do they affect any of the subsidy estimates <a href=\"{% url tarp-subsidies %}\">presented on the Subsidyscope web site</a>. All of those estimates were developed using the strike prices in the actual signed contracts between Treasury and the companies receiving TARP funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, further analysis suggests that had Treasury used the alternative strike prices in the contracts, the aggregate subsidy costs of the TARP program would have been only slightly lower.  The warrants provide only a small fraction of the TARP subsidies; most of the subsidies are actually channeled through the government's purchases of preferred stock.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>For example, the BAC warrants account for about 3 percent of the total market value of the assets (preferred stock and warrants) that the government received from BAC.<sup>1</sup>  So, even if the terms of the warrants had been considerably more favorable to the government, the aggregate subsidies provided to BAC would have been only slightly lower.  Analysis of the warrants provided to other companies confirms this general conclusion.  On average, warrants account for only 4 percent of the total assets that the government received for the 10 largest TARP transactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Treasury's decision to use the date of application as the key date for determining the strike price probably makes more sense from an administrative perspective than using the date that the warrants are issued.  If the issue dates had been used, neither Treasury nor the bank receiving TARP funds would have known the exact terms of the warrant until 4 pm on the day before the contract was signed, which would have limited the amount of time that Treasury and bank staff had to review the terms of the contract.  More deals could have fallen apart at the last minute (which would have raised overall administrative costs of the TARP program), and some institutions might have been deterred from seeking TARP money, which would have undermined the goals of the program.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, inconsistencies in the documents that the Treasury Department uses to describe TARP to the public highlight a need for government officials to improve their communication about the program and reduce misunderstandings.  Miscommunications from the government have consequences: at least one bank relied on the Treasury's description of TARP program in its SEC filing and as a result, inadvertently misstated the terms of the warrants.<sup>2</sup></p> \r\n\t", "locked": 0, "page": 14, "name": "text2"}}, {"pk": 11, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "{% load glossary_tags %}\r\n\r\n{% glossarize %}\r\n\r\n<P>Another measure of the fund's instability is the number of problem institutions insured by the FDIC \u2014 institutions with weaknesses that threaten their continued financial viability.

And they say the potential losses are never likely to be realized, because the banks intend to hold the securities to maturity. By then, spokespeople predict that the economy will have improved and their holdings will have recovered some or all of their value. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal Home Loan Banks already maintain a thinner capital margin than is typical for commercial banks, however. Because they have an implicit government guarantee\u2014investors believe the federal government won't let them fail\u2014they're able to maintain slimmer reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last fall, the FHLBs' private mortgage-backed securities had already run into enough trouble to raise concerns about capital levels. In January, Moody's reported that in the worst-case scenario, if their securities never regained their former value, eight of the 12 home loan banks would fail to meet capital requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Home loan bank representatives defend their smaller capital margin. As their 2008 combined financial report shows, the majority of FHLB assets\u2014about 70 percent\u2014are made up of advances, or loans to member banks. Those advances are extremely secure for investors: when a member institution takes out a loan, it must put up more collateral than the loan is worth. And the FHLBs are first in line to be paid back if a member bank fails. In fact, in their 77-year history, the home loan banks have never lost a penny on an advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Private mortgage-backed securities, however, don't enjoy these extra safeguards\u2014and they're much riskier than advances. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the measure that the FHLBs\u2019 regulator must use by law to determine if the banks are adequately capitalized may make them appear healthier than they are.  For example, the Seattle FHLB had only $960 million of capital on March 31, 2009, according to generally accepted accounting principles.  For regulatory purposes, however, the Seattle FHLB was allowed to state that its capital was almost $3 billion (see graphic below).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this review, Subsidyscope used the measure of capital that accountants use, in part because regulatory capital doesn\u2019t count the losses a bank suffered on its mortgage-backed securities and can be potentially misleading.

Before it ever reached insolvency, the bank could take internal steps to save money: it could suspend dividends to its members and temporarily forbid them from withdrawing stock, among other remedies. Indeed, six of the 12 banks have announced since December 2008 that they are suspending dividends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, all the FHLBs are responsible if one runs into trouble. The home loan banks are subject to \"joint and several liability\"\u2014meaning that if one bank were to fail, the others would be liable. The other FHLBs may also provide capital if a bank simply needs additional funds, but is still solvent. Just how they would accomplish this is far from clear, however.  The individual FHLBs are used to a high degree of independence, so any bailout of one by the others is likely to be contentious and take time to resolve. The worry for taxpayers is that if the entire FHLB system still fell short of required capital, it might have to turn to Congress for extra funds. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is some evidence that confidence in the Federal Home Loan Banks among investors has eroded in recent months.  Subsidyscope has obtained information on the price of credit default swaps on FHLB bonds (see graphic below).  One way the home loan banks fund their loans to members is by selling bonds. Credit default swap prices are a measure of how expensive it is to buy insurance against the possibility that the FHLBs would default on their bonds.  The data show that it has become increasingly expensive to buy this insurance, suggesting that investors' confidence in the health of the FHLBs has been waning of late. </p>", "locked": 0, "page": 8, "name": "text4"}}, {"pk": 34, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p>Both the <a href=\"{% url tarp-subsidies-cop %}\">Congressional Oversight Panel</a> and the <a href=\"{% url tarp-subsidies-cbo %}\">Congressional Budget Office</a> have begun providing estimates of the TARP subsidies and subsidy rates. Among the institutions receiving some of the largest subsidies, the estimators find tremendous variation in subsidy rates (see below). The numbers from both agencies reflect estimates at a specific point in time. For example, the COP estimates reflected the subsidy costs to the government when the government purchased the preferred stock and warrants from the companies.  However, because the subsidy estimates depend on market conditions, those subsidy estimates can change over time.  If market conditions deteriorate, as they have for a number of financial companies, the size of the subsidies will increase.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<p><small>Source for GM Corp and GMAC LLC: Congressional Budget Office, <a href=\"{% url bailoutpdf_detail 15 %}\">The Troubled Asset Relief Program: Report on Transactions Through December 31, 2008</a>, 01/09; All other data from: Congressional Oversight Panel, <a href=\"{% url bailoutpdf_detail 22 %}\">February Oversight Report, Valuing Treasury's Acquisitions</a>, 2/6/09.</small></p>\r\n\t\t<p><small>* The figure for Citigroup is a combination of the subsidies it received through two separate programs (Capital Purchase Program and Systemically Significant Failing Institutions) and that were individually estimated by COP.</small></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t", "locked": 0, "page": 11, "name": "text4"}}]
