PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  In FY 2008, BJS continues to work to fully implement the data collection and
  reporting requirements under the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003. Between
  April and August 2007, BJS completed the first National Inmate Survey (NIS),
  using Audio Computer-Assisted Self Interview methods, of 146 State and
  Federal prisons. A total of 23,398 inmates participated in the survey. Survey
  procedures and questionnaires for the National Survey of Youth in Custody
  (NSYC)have been tested and results were presented to juvenile administrators
  and other stakeholders on August 28, 2007. National implementation is expected
  in June 2008. When fully implemented, the NSYC will include about 15,000
  adjudicated youth in a sample of 208 State operated facilities and 48 large non-
  State facilities. In early 2008 national implementation began of the Former
  Prisoner Survey (FPS). The survey will include about 16,500 former inmates in a
  sample of 285 parole offices. BJS has also begun work on the National Prison
  Rape Surveillance Project, which is a study using medical indicators and
  medical surveillance methodologies to measure the incidence and prevalence of
  sexual assault in correctional facilities. Latest data can be found in the BJS
  reports, Sexual Victimization in State and Federal Prisons as Reported by
  Inmates, 2007 (NCJ 219414) and Sexual Violence Reported by Correctional
  Authorities, 2006 (NCJ 218914).
