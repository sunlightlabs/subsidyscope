  The SBA will provide funds, the amount being determined on a pro-rata share of       
  of approximately $89,000,000 based on the population to be served by the             
  SBDC as compared to the total population in the United States, with no State         
  receiving less than $500,000, or whichever is greater. The entity generally is       
  required to provide nonfederal funds of at least a 1:1 match, although additional    
  funds may also be contributed by nonfederal sources. At least 50 percent of          
  matching funds must be in cash; the balance may be made up of in-kind                
  contributions and indirect costs. Occasionally legislation will not require
