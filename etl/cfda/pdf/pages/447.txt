  Project planning studies are undertaken in a single feasibility phase. The first  
  $100,000 is federally funded. Additional study costs are shared 50/50 with local  
  sponsor. Local cost participation requirements and procedures for determining     
  the local share of project cost are similar to those for beach erosion control    
  projects specifically authorized by Congress under regular authorization          
  procedures, but Federal participation cannot exceed $2,000,000, the               
  determination of local costs is based on the public use and ownership of the      
  beach protected.
