  land enhancement benefits or other special local benefits; provide all necessary
  lands, easements, rights-of-way; hold and save the United States free from
  damages; and, provide adequate public landing or wharf, piers, access roads,
  parking areas and other needed public facilities open and available to all on

  determining the local share of project cost are similar to those for navigation
  projects specifically authorized by Congress under regular authorization
  procedures. No project is to be recommended for implementation under the
  Section 107 authority for which the total constant dollar Federal costs over 50
