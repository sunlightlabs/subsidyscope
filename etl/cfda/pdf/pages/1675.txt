OBJECTIVES:                                                                           
  To support analyses, experiments, demonstrations and pilot projects in efforts to   
  resolve major health care financing issues and to develop innovative methods for    
  the administration of Medicare and Medicaid. These awards are in the form of        
  research grants and cooperative agreements; Hispanic health services grants;        
  historically black colleges and university grants. For fiscal years 2007 and 2008,  
  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has identified a number of       
  areas where specific information or experience is necessary to improve program      
  effectiveness or guide decisions anticipated in the near future. These priority     
  areas for CMS' discretionary contracts, cooperative agreements and grants           
  include: (1) protecting and empowering specific populations; (2) pay for            
  performance for multiple provider settings; (3) understanding health differences    
  and disparities--closing the gaps; (4) preventing disease, illness, and injury; (5) 
  agency-specific priorities.

  Act are limited to State agencies administering the Medicaid program.
Applicant Eligibility:
  Grants or cooperative agreements may be made to private, or public agencies or
  organizations, including State agencies that administer the Medicaid program.
  Private profit organizations may apply. For the Small Business Innovation
  Research Grant Program, only for-profit organizations may apply. Awards

  non-CMS facilities or services. Costs will be determined in accordance with
  OMB Circular No. A-102 for State and local governments. The standard forms,
  as furnished by DHHS and required by OMB Circular No. A-102, must be used.
Preapplication Coordination:
  CMS research and demonstration projects are solicited by publication in the
  "Federal Register," requests of proposals for contracts in "FedBizOpps," targeted
  program announcements, and other appropriate means. Some funds are used for
  creative, unsolicited proposals. Applicants should maintain contact with
  Regional CMS Offices (see Appendix IV of the Catalog for listing). The
  standard application forms, as furnished by CMS, must be used for this program.
  This program is excluded from coverage under E.O. 12372.

  closing date of each solicitation cycle.
Award Procedure:
  Official notice of approved applications is made through issuance of a Notice of

  applications may be submitted at any time.
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:
  Range from 150 to 180 days.
Appeals:

  solicited proposals, extensions may be allowed to prepare revisions which clarify
  various aspects of projects.
Renewals:
  Extensions and continuations of projects are available if formally applied for and
  approved. If a grant/cooperative agreement application is recommended for
  approval for 2 or more years, the awardee must annually submit a formal request
  for continuation accompanied by a progress report which will be evaluated prior
  to a recommendation of continuation.
Formula and Matching Requirements:
  Awardees are required to share in the cost of projects. Normally, the minimum
  cost-sharing requirement is 5 percent of total project costs. This program has no
  statutory formula, except in Section 1115 projects, where the statutory formula is
  the same as that established for the Medicaid Program, both administrative and
  operational.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  Grants/cooperative agreements are generally funded on a 12-month basis, with
  support beyond the first year contingent upon acceptable evidence of satisfactory
  progress, continuing program relevance, and availability of funds.
