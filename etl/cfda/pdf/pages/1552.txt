  To assist States and communities in establishing and maintaining preventive         
  health service programs to immunize individuals against vaccine-preventable         
  diseases (including measles, rubella, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus,

  Grant funds may be used for costs associated with planning, organizing, and         
  conducting immunization programs directed toward vaccine-preventable                
  diseases and for the purchase of vaccine; and for the implementation of other       
  program elements, such as assessment of the problem; surveillance and outbreak      
  control; information and education; adequate notification of the risks and          
  benefits of immunization; compliance with compulsory school immunization            
  laws; vaccine storage, supply, and delivery; citizen participation; and use of

PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  The nation's childhood immunization coverage rates are at record high levels for
  most vaccines and for all the vaccination series measures. As childhood
  immunization coverage rates increase, cases of vaccine preventable disease
  decline significantly. One performance measure is used to ensure that children
  are appropriately vaccinated by age two. For the past five years, the 90 percent
  coverage target has been exceeded for four of the seven routinely recommended
  childhood vaccine (Hib, MMR, hepatitis B, and polio) and has almost reached
  the 90 percent target for varicella (currently at 89 percent). Another important
  performance measure is the increased proportion of adults who are vaccinated
  annually against influenza and ever vaccinated against pneumococcal disease
  among persons 65 years of age and older. Influenza vaccination coverage levels
  among the elderly have increased from 30 percent in 1989 to 64 percent in 2006
  and pneumococcal vaccination levels have increased form 15 percent in 1989 to
  57 percent in 2006.

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  The majority of official State Health Departments (such as California, Michigan,
  and Texas) and some large local health departments (such as New York and
  Chicago) have ongoing disease control programs utilizing these grants.
  Immunization Projects: The national program goals for immunization are to
  reduce morbidity and mortality due to vaccine-preventable diseases; maintain
  interruption of indigenous measles transmission; prevent perinatal transmission
  of hepatitis b; maintain 95 percent immunization levels for school enterers, and
  90 percent immunization levels for children enrolled in licensed day-care centers
  against measles, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, rubella, mumps,
  and Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib); develop, test, and implement systems
  for use in the States to ensure that 90 percent or more of children complete basic
  immunizations by age 2; and promote appropriate immunization programs for
  adults. Effective comprehensive programs, include the following elements: (1)
