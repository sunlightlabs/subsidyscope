  Law 93-638 procedures to contract for construction of the Animas-La Plata         
  Project with the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.        
  Construction contracts for estimated quantities and with firm fixed unit pricing  
  are issued to accomplish the work. For projects under this program that are not   
  required to be awarded subject to Public Law 93-638, funding opportunity          
  announcements, along with registration procedures, application packages and       
  instructions, SF-424 forms and any other forms to be used to submit application   
  information, points of contact, and procedures for submitting applications will

  An initial statement of work is issued to the Tribe for review and pricing by the 
  Contract Specialist. The Tribe reviews the initial statement of work, submits

  cost estimate is evaluated by the Government Technical Team, the Government       
  Cost and Price Analyst, Contract Specialist, Contract Administrator, and          
  Contracting Officer. Negotiations are held on the various elements until an       
  agreement is reached and an award is then made. For projects not awarded          
  subject to Public Law 93-638, all applications will be initially screened for     
  eligibility and compliance with the requirements stated in the program funding    
  announcement. Applications passing this screening process will be forwarded       
  for review by a proposal evaluation panel comprised of qualified experts in the   
  program area. Applications will be reviewed against the proposal evaluation       
  criteria, and any additional review factors, as stated in the funding             
  announcement. Final selection will be determined by the Commissioner, Bureau      
  of Reclamation, or regional officials, as applicable to the project.

  will be available for each specific project at the time the funding opportunity   
  announcement is posted on www.grants.gov and may be obtained by contacting        
  the Reclamation personnel listed as the point of contact in the funding           
  announcement.
