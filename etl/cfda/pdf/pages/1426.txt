  In fiscal year 2007, 56 grants were made to States and related jurisdictions. The
  principal role of the Ombudsman Program is to investigate and resolve            
  complaints made by or on behalf of residents. Ombudsmen also promote policies    
  and practices needed to improve the quality of care and life in long-term care   
  facilities, and educate both consumers and providers about residents' rights and 
  good care practices. Projected Ombudsman accomplishments for 2007 include:       
  identify, investigate and resolve complaints made by or on behalf of residents;  
  provide information to residents about long-term care services; represent the    
  interests of residents before governmental agencies and seek administrative,     
  legal and other remedies to protect residents; analyze, comment on and           
  recommend changes in laws and regulations pertaining to the health, safety,      
  welfare and rights of residents; educate and inform consumers and the general    
  public regarding issues and concerns related to long-term care and facilitate    
  public comment on laws, regulations, policies and actions; promote the           
  development of citizen organizations to participate in the program; provide      
  technical support for the development of resident and family councils to protect 
  the well-being and rights of residents; and advocate for changes to improve      
  resident's quality of life and care.
