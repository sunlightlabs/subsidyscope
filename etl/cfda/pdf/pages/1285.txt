  programs.                                                                            
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                   
  Formula Grants.

  Each State may keep up to 5 percent of its award for state administration and up     
  to 10 percent of its award to fund leadership activities (and from that amount, it   
  must reserve an amount equivalent to 1 percet of its award to assist individuals     
  in state institutions and between $60,000 and $150,000 to fund services to           
  prepare individuals for non-traditional fields). Each State must distribute at least 
  85 percent of its award to local agencies to fund secondary and postsecondary        
  institutions that provide career and technical education services, from which the    
  state may choose to award an amount equivalent to 10% of its award to make           
  awards to local agencies in rural areas, areas with high percentages of career and   
  technical education students, and areas with high numbers of career and              
  technical education students. This program is subject to non-supplanting             
  requirements and must use a restricted indirect cost rate which is referenced        
  under 34 CFR 76-564-76.569. For assistance call the Office of the Chief              
  Financial Officer/Indirect Cost Group on (202) 708-7770.

  A 5-year State plan for Vocational Education must be prepared with the active        
  participation of the State Council. State plans are subject to public hearings.      
  This program is eligible for coverage under E.O. 12372, "Intergovernmental           
  Review of Federal Programs." An applicant should consult the office or official      
  designated as the single point of contact in his or her State for more information   
  on the process the State requires to be followed in applying for assistance, if the  
  State has selected the program for review.                                           
Application Procedure:

Award Procedure:                                                                       
  The Department of Education approves the 5-year State plan and makes                 
  allocations to the States.                                                           
Deadlines:                                                                             
  States should contact the Program Office for deadlines.

  The range is approximately 30 to 120 days.                                           
Appeals:                                                                               
  A State board which is dissatisfied with the final action of the Assistant           
  Secretary in disapproving a State Plan is afforded reasonable notice and             
  opportunity for a hearing.                                                           
Renewals:                                                                              
  None.                                                                                
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                     
  The funding formula is based on State per-capita income and population in three      
  age cohorts (15-19,20-24, and 25-65). The formula provides for a minimum             
  State allocation of at least 0.5 percent of the total, and a "hold-harmless"         
  provision in the formula ensures that no State's share of the appropriation is less  
  than its share of the fiscal year 1998 appropriation. A special provision limits     
  the increase a State with an initial allocation of the 0.5 percent minimum may       
  receive, resulting in a number of States that receive an allocation of less than 0.5 
  percent of the total. If appropriations result in the amount of funds for allocation 
  to States exceeding the amount of funds allocated to States from the FY 2006         
  appropriation, up to one-third of the additional funds are allotted to States with   
  FY 2006 grants that are less than the minimum 0.5 percent grant amount and the       
  remainder would flow to the other States. In addition, the Pacific territories       
  receive 0.13 percent of the total appropriated for State Grants to operate the

  same kinds of career and technical education programs as the States. Also, 1.25      
  percent of the total appropriation for State Grants is set aside for grants to

  federally recognized Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and 0.25 percent is     
  set aside for competitive grants to organizations that primarily serve and           
  represent Hawaiian Natives. The Bureau of the Census supplies the population         
  data; the Department of Labor supplies the per-capia income data. Matching.          
  Section 102 of the Perkins Acts requries 50/50 matching for State                    
  administration. No match is required for American Samoa, the Northern                
  Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Guam, or the Republic of Palau. Section         


1098                                                                             11-08
