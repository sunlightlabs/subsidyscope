  the eligible costs, except for National Primate Research Centers for which the    
  Federal share is 80 percent. Up to 25 percent of appropriated funds are targeted  
  to Centers of Excellence. Matching funds from nonfederal sources are required.    
  Even though matching funds are required, in unusual and compelling                
  circumstances the NCRR Director may waive some or all of the requirement for      
  nonfederal matching funds. All other programs: None.                              
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                              
  All programs except for RFIP: 1 to 5 years. An Electronic Transfer System is      
  used for transferring funds. RFIP: Construction must be completed within the      
  time specified in grant award. The initial budget period is usually 2 years in    
  length, although extensions may be requested. All funds must be obligated         
  within 5 years from the date of award.                                            
Reports:                                                                            
  Annual progress and financial status reports are required for all grants. Final   
  performance and financial reports are required 90 days following the end of the   
  project period. Reports are required after termination of NRSA to ascertain       
  compliance with the service and payback provisions. RFIP: The grantee is          
  responsible for performance of the contractor. The contractor must be covered     
  by performance and payment bonds.                                                 
Audits:                                                                             
  In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A- 133 (Revised, June       
  24,1997), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations,"    
  nonfederal entities that expend financial assistance of $300,000 or more in       
  Federal awards will have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that  
  year. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $300,000 a year in Federal        
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted  
  in Circular No. A-133. In addition, grants and cooperative agreements are         
  subject to inspection and audits by DHHS and other Federal government             
  officials.

  Expenditures and other financial records must be retained for 3 years from the    
  day on which the grantee submits the final financial status report for the report 
  period.

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  BT: Supported research projects, biomedical technology resources, and
  exploratory grants that develop and disseminate complex techniques and
  equipment to the biomedical research community Examples include: (1) The
  analysis using synchrotron X-rays of the crystal structure of the myosin head that
  is the key to the contraction of muscle; (2) development of a two-photon laser
  method to directly explore chemical processes in living cells; and (3) use of a
  computer network and a super computer to remotely operate an electron
  microscope in real time and analyze the image. SIG: Types of instruments
  supported include but are not limited to: electron microscopes, NMR
  spectrometers, mass spectrometers, DNA sequencers, image analyzers, and
  computer graphics systems. CR: A typical center supports multiple projects
  from many disciplines, such as internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, and
  obstetrics and gynecology. Projects may relate to all aspects of disease
  mechanisms and may include projects in nutrition, diabetes, growth and
  development, genetics, immunology, AIDS and other areas. SEPA: (1)
  improving the scientific knowledge base of current and prospective precollege
  teachers and teachers' instructional skills can be enhanced. (2) developing
  innovative materials, techniques, and/or curricula where there is a demonstrated
  lack of suitable materials and a need for scientific advice. (3) organizing and
  conducting programs to provide for laboratory experiences in the biological
  sciences for students from kindergarten through twelfth grade levels. (4)
  preparation and/or presentation of materials for biomedical/behavioral science
  education or for a media program on science. CM: Eight National Primate
  Research Centers are supported to provide special environments in models. They
  maintain colonies of over 18,000 animals, representing 32 species of nonhuman
  primates, for research and breeding purposes. Projects for the characterization
  and development of animal models were supported, but were limited to those
  that displayed potential for multi-categorical utilization. Projects that attempt to
  establish an animal model for a specific disease should be directed to the
  Institute/Center of NIH that supports categorical research in that area. The
  etiology and control of important naturally-occurring laboratory animal diseases
  have been studied. Biological Models and Materials Research Resource centers
  were supported to provide a large variety of materials to the research
  community. These centers acquire, authenticate, maintain, and distribute
  biomaterials to both basic researchers and clinical investigators. For example,
  resources distribute invertebrates such as squid, mollusks, and nematodes),
  cultures of microorganisms, cell lines, fungi, yeast, hybridomas, cloned genes,
  DNA probes and libraries, and recombinant DNA and oncogenes. Also
  supported is a project to collect data on the genes and metabolism of the
  bacterium Escherichia coli and to encode this information in a computer
  database that allows investigators to access genetic metabolic data in a graphic,
  user-friendly manner. RI: RCMI: (1) Research Center for Gene Structure and
  Function; (2) Cellular and Molecular Basis of Development Research Center; (3)
  Neuroscience Center; and (4) Research Infrastructure for Scientific Excellence.
  RCRII: Research Infrastructure for Clinical and Collaborative Research. IDeA:
  Human Genetics Research Enhancement. RFIP: Developing and Improving
  Institutional Animal Resources. Institutional animal resource improvement
  projects were supported to assist institutions in upgrading and developing
  centralized animal resource programs.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
  The major elements in evaluating proposals include assessments of: (1) The
  scientific merit and general significance of the proposed study and its
