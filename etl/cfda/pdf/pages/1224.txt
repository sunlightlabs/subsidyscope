  Disputes will be resolved under 40 CFR 30.63 or 40 CFR 31.70, as applicable.       
Renewals:                                                                            
  Each State and tribal cooperative agreement will be evaluated on an annual basis   
   to ensure that the requirements to receive funding are being met. If funding is   
  not used, it may be carried over into the next budget period.                      
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                   
  States and tribes are not required to provide matching funds for grants awarded    
  under Section 128(a). However, if the state or tribe uses Section 128(a) funds to  
  capitalize a Brownfields RLF under CERCLA 104(k)(3), a 20% cost share is           
  required on the amount of Section 128(a) funds used to capitalize an RLF . This    
  program has no statutory formula, but does take into account use of prior years'   
  funding in determining future awards.                                              
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                               
  EPA regions will evaluate cooperative agreements annually to ensure that           
  requirements to receive funding are being met. EPA regional offices will           
  determine the project period for each cooperative agreement. These may be for      
  multiple years depending on the regional office's grants policies. Each            
  cooperative agreement must have an annual budget period tied to an annual          
  work plan. Funds are awarded on an annual basis and may be drawn down              
  according to regional financial processes.                                         
Reports:                                                                             
  States and tribes will provide progress reports under 40 CFR 31.40, in             
  accordance with terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement negotiated       
  with EPA regional offices. As a minimum, state or tribal progress reports must     
  include both a narrative discussion and performance data relating to the state's or
  tribe's accomplishments with Section 128(a) funding. Depending upon the            
  activities included in the state's or tribe's scope of work, an EPA regional office
  may request that a progress report include other elements as described in the      
  Grant Funding Guidance for State and Tribal Response Programs. The regional        
  offices may also request other information be added to the progress reports, as    
  appropriate, to properly document activities described by the cooperative          
  agreement work plan.                                                               
Audits:                                                                              
  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the     
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,     
  other EPA staff, or any authorized representative of the Federal government.

  Reviews by the EPA Project Officer and the Grants Specialist may occur each        
  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,

  June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit               
  Organizations," nonfederal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in      
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that  
  year. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal         
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted   
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.                                                         
Records:                                                                             
  In addition to the statutory public record requirement, states and tribes must     
  comply with record keeping requirements of 40 CFR Part 31 and any applicable       
  requirements under state and tribal laws. Recipients must keep financial records,  
  including all documents supporting entries on accounting records and to            
  substantiate changes in grants, available to personnel authorized to examine       
  EPA recipients grants and cooperative agreements records. All records must be      
  maintained until expiration of three years from the date of submission of the      
  final expenditure report. If questions remain following the three-year period,     
  such as those raised as a result of an audit or an on-going enforcement action,    
  recipients must retain records until the matter is completely resolved.

  FY 07 $49,300,000; FY 08 $49,800,000; and FY 09 est. $49,300,000.                  
Range and Average of Financial Assistance:                                           
  Most fiscal years range from $50,000 to $1,500,000; average approximately          
  $500,000. For FY 08, funding request are limited to a maximum of $1,500,000        
  per State or tribe.                                                                
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:                                                             
  In FY 07, 109 requests for funding were received. In FY 08, 110 requests for       
  funding were received. In FY 07, 104 states and tribes were able to establish and  
  enhance their response programs as a result of funding support from this           
  program. In FY 08, 107 states and tribes were able to establish and enhance their  
  response programs as a result of funding support from this program.

  of sites, including making information available on the Internet and maintaining
  and monitoring institutional controls; capitalizing an RLF for brownfields
  cleanup; purchasing environmental insurance; developing legislation,
  regulations, procedures, and guidance that would establish or enhance the
  administrative and legal structure of their response programs; and undertaking-
  site specific related activities, such as conducting assessments at selected
  brownfields sites and auditing completed site cleanups in states that administer a
  licensed site professional program.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:

66.818 BROWNFIELDS ASSESSMENT AND CLEANUP
COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS
FEDERAL AGENCY:
  OFFICE OF BROWNFIELDS AND LAND REVITALIZATION, OFFICE OF
  SOLID WASTE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE, ENVIRONMENTAL
  PROTECTION AGENCY
AUTHORIZATION:
  The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002,
  (Pub .L.No. 107-118, 115 stat. 2356, "the Brownfields Law") Sections 101(39)
  and 104(k) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
  Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended by, 42 U.S.C. 9601(39) and 42 U.
  S.C.9604(k).
OBJECTIVES:
  Brownfield sites are real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of
  which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous
  substance, pollutant, or contaminant. The objectives of the brownfield
  assessment, revolving loan fund and cleanup cooperative agreements (project
  grants) are to provide funding: (1) to inventory, characterize, assess, and conduct
  planning and community involvement related to brownfield sites; (2) to
  capitalize a revolving loan fund (RLF) and provide subgrants to carry out
  cleanup activities at brownfield sites; and (3) to carry out cleanup activities at
  brownfield sites that are owned by the grant recipient. Funding Priority - Fiscal
  Year 2008: By statute, 25 percent of the funding for this program must be used
  for characterization, assessment, and cleanup of Brownfields sites contaminated
  by petroleum or petroleum products. The Agency must also give preference to
  statutory ranking criteria found at CERCLA 104(k)(5)(C) (see CRITERIA FOR
  SELECTING PROPOSALS) when evaluating applications for funding.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Project Grants (Cooperative Agreements).
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  For site specific projects, the site must meet the definition of a brownfields site
  found at CERCLA 101(39). As part of the application process, EPA provides
  guidance to assist grant applicants in determining whether sites meet this
  definition. (1) The brownfields grants may be used to address sites
  contaminated by petroleum and hazardous substances, pollutants, or
  contaminants (including hazardous substances co-mingled with petroleum). (2)
  Brownfields assessment grant funds may be used to inventory, characterize,
  assess, and conduct planning and community involvement related to brownfield
  sites. (3) An RLF project grant recipient must use at least 60 percent of the
  awarded funds to capitalize and implement a revolving loan fund; an RLF
  project grant recipient may use no more than 40 percent of the awarded funds for
  cleanup subgrants and may not subgrant to itself. Revolving loan fund project
  grants generally are used to provide no-interest or low-interest loans for
                                                                                  1037
