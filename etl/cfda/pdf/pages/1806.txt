   (FMA)
FEDERAL AGENCY:
  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
AUTHORIZATION:
  National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, Title V, Sections 553 and 554,
  Public Law 103-325, 42 U.S.C. 5154a.
OBJECTIVES:
  To assist States and communities in implementing measures to reduce or
  eliminate the long-term risk of flood damage to buildings, manufactured homes,
  and other structures insurable under the National Flood Insurance Program
  (NFIP).
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Project Grants.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  States are encouraged to use FMA planning, project and technical assistance
  grants to reduce the number of repetitive loss structures insured by the NFIP.
  More specifically, the emphasis is on reducing target repetitive loss properties
  that include structures with four or more losses, and structures with two or more
  losses where cumulative payments have exceeded the property value. Planning
  Grants may be used to assist States and communities in developing and updating
  Flood Mitigation Plans. Eligible activities under this grant are: conducting local
  planning discussions, contracting for consulting technical services such as
  engineering and planning; surveying structures at risk; and assessing structures
  subject to repetitive flood loss. There are several restrictions on Planning
  Grants. Planning Grants will not exceed a maximum of $1,500,000 nationally
  each year. A Planning Grant will not be awarded to a State or a community
  more than one every 5 years. Individual Planning Grants will not exceed
  $150,000 to any State applicant, or exceed $50,000 to any community applicant.
  The total planning grant made in any fiscal year to any State, including
  communities located in the State will not exceed $300,000. Project Grants may
  be used to assist States and communities in implementing flood mitigation
  projects to reduce the risk of flood damage to structures insured or insurable
  under the National Flood Insurance Program. Eligible activities under this grant
  include the acquisition, relocation, or elevation of insured structures. Only
  mitigation activities specified in a FEMA-approved Flood Mitigation Plan are
  eligible for an FMA Project Grant. There are several restrictions on Project
  Grants. The combined total of project and technical assistance awarded to the
  State and all communities in that State is limited to $20,000,000 in a 5-year
  period. There are also limits on the amount of Project Grant funds that any one
  State or community can receive in a 5-year period. States can receive individual
  grants not totaling more than $10,000,000 in a 5-year period. Communities can
                                                                                  1619
