  Vessel Safety Checks (VSC), which are free checks of safety-related equipment
  on recreational boats. Boats that pass the VSC are given a "Seal of Safety" decal
  which indicates the boat met Federal and pertinent State safety-related
  equipment requirements. If deficiencies are found, the owner is advised of such,
  but no report is made to any law enforcement authority and a decal is not issued.
  Auxiliarists also support virtually all Coast Guard missions except direct law
  enforcement and combat operations. They offer their personal boats, airplanes,
  radios, and vehicles to perform operational and support activities like marine
  safety patrols, public outreach, and other recreational boating safety missions.
