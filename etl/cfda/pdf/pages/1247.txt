  Office of Science research programs, which complement DOE's applied                 
  missions in energy resources, environmental quality, and national security, have    
  been at the forefront of modern scientific advances and have expanded the           
  frontiers of basic scientific knowledge. Results and accomplishments of basic       
  research performed under these programs are reported in open scientific             
  literature. University research programs often support graduate students who        
  assist principal investigators with research projects. Student support on basic     
  science research projects has helped to train the future scientific talent in DOE   
  supported science areas such as materials science, chemistry, mathematics,          
  general life sciences, geosciences, genetics, radiation biology, ecology, nuclear   
  medicine, and high energy and nuclear physics. Nobel prizes, Fermi awards, and      
  Lawrence awards have been awarded to DOE supported researchers.
