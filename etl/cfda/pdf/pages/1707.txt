OBJECTIVES:
  To encourage biomedical, social, and behavioral research and research training
  directed toward greater understanding of the aging process and the diseases,
  special problems, and needs of people as they age. The National Institute on
  Aging has established programs to pursue these goals. The biology of aging
  program emphasizes understanding the basic biological processes of aging. The
  geriatrics program supports research to improve the abilities of health care
  practitioners to respond to the diseases and other clinical problems of older
  people. The behavioral and social research program supports research that will
  lead to greater understanding of the social, cultural, economic and psychological
  factors that affect both the process of growing old and the place of older people
  in society. The neuroscience and neuropsychology of aging program fosters
  research concerned with the age-related changes in the nervous system as well as
  the related sensory, perceptual, and cognitive processes associated with aging.
  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program: To expand and improve
  the SBIR program; to increase private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; to increase small business
  participation in Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage
  participation of socially and economically disadvantaged small business
  concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological
  innovation. Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program: To stimulate
  and foster scientific and technological innovation through cooperative research
  development carried out between small business concerns and research
  institutions; to foster technology transfer between small business concerns and
  research institutions; to increase private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage
  participation of socially and economically disadvantaged small business
  concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological
  innovation.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Project Grants.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  Research grants are intended to support the direct costs of a project in
  accordance with an approved budget, plus an appropriate amount for indirect
  costs. Grantees must agree to administer the grant in accordance with the
  regulations and policies governing the research grants program of the Public
  Health Service. National Research Service Awards (NRSA) (Individual) are
  made directly to approved applicants for research training in specified
  biomedical shortage areas. In addition, National Research Service Awards
  (Institutional) may be made to institutions to enable them to make NRSAs to
  individuals selected by them. Each individual who receives a NRSA is
  obligated, upon termination of the award, to comply with certain service and
  payback provisions. Regulations are published in the Code of Federal
