  focused on the solid earth, glacial and sea ice, terrestrial ecosystems, the oceans,  
  the atmosphere and beyond. Major objectives include understanding of the              
  natural phenomena and processes in the Antarctic and Arctic regions and their         
  role in global systems. To provide postdoctoral fellowships for the development       
  and training of new investigators in polar regions research with goals to support     
  innovative research in emerging areas, encourage interdisciplinary research,          
  foster activities that create broader impacts for science and society, and to         
  increase the participation of underrepresented groups. Support is also provided       
  for science and technology centers, undergraduate student research, facility          
  enhancement, instrumentation, and laboratory equipment; and for research              
  opportunities for women, minority, and disabled scientists and engineers.

  NSF staff members review and evaluate all proposals usually with the assistance       
  and advice of other qualified scientists, and other appropriate persons, who are      
  specialists in the field covered by the proposal. Awards are made in order of         
  merit and program relevance to the extent permitted by available funds. States        
  will be notified of Federal assistance awards through the Federal Assistance          
  Awards Data System (FAADS).

  Many NSF programs accept proposals at any time. Other programs, however,              
  establish due dates for submission of proposals. NSF utilizes Target Dates,           
  Deadline Dates, and Submission Windows. Consult the Grant Proposal Guide,             
  Section I.F. for a further description of these types of due dates.

  The Principal Investigator whose proposal for support has been declined may           
  request, in writing, and receive from the cognizant program officer the reasons       
  for declination. The proposer may also obtain verbatim copies of reviews of           
  his/her proposals, though not the names of reviewers. If not satisfied, the           
  Principal Investigator may request that the Foundation reconsider the procedural      
  aspects of the declination action. Request for reconsideration must be received       
  within 90 days of the declination letter.                                             
Renewals:                                                                               
  Standard grants may be renewed once by amendment of the original grant,               
  provided the cumulative duration does not exceed 5 years. Proposals for renewal       
  should be submitted 6 months prior to the expiration of the original grant and        
  should contain the same type of information as the original proposal plus a           
  summary of progress to date, a proposed budget for the ensuing period, and a          
  statement of expenditures to date and existing commitments that will require          
  expenditure of residual funds from the original grant after the requested renewal     
  date. Renewals compete with other proposals for available funds.                      
Formula and Matching Requirements:

  Grant Policy Manual (Sec. 330) provide additional information on the general
  NSF policy on cost-sharing.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  Normally 1 to 3 years.
Reports:
  For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the PI
  must submit an annual project report to the cognizant program office at least 90
  days before the end of the current budget period. Within 90 days after the

  Federal Cash Transaction Reports are required. Other reporting requirements
  may be imposed via the grant instrument.

  Organizations," nonfederal entities that expend financial assistance of $500,000
  or more in Federal awards will have a single or a program-specific audit
  conducted for that year. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $500,000 a
  year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year,
  except as noted in Circular No. A-133.
Records:
  Grantees are expected to maintain separate records for each grant to ensure that
  funds are used for the general purpose for which the grant was made. Records
  are subject to inspection during the life of the grant and for three years
  thereafter.

CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
  The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating proposals at
  its meeting on March 28, 1997 (NSB 97-72). All NSF proposals are evaluated
  through use of the two merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF
  will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of
  certain programs and activities. On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued
  Important Notice 127, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide
  Requirements Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice
  reinforces the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and
  review of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its
  internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria are addressed
  when making funding decisions. In an effort to increase compliance with these
  requirements, the January 2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised
  proposal preparation guidelines relating to the development of the Project
