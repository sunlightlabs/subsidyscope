  The Construction Reserve Fund (CRF), authorized under Section 511 of the Act,     
  is a financial assistance program which provides tax deferral benefits to U.S.    
  flag operators. The CRF permits the fundholder to deposit gains attributable to   
  the sale of or indemnification for loss of vessels and to defer tax on such gains 
  provided the gains are to be reinvested in vessels. Also the CRF allows the       


                                                                               11-08
  accumulation of earnings from operations of vessels documented in the U.S., or
  the earnings from the investment of the Fund. The ability to accumulate funds
  and the tax deferral provision have enabled fundholders to construct or
  reconstruct in the United States and documented under the laws of the United
  States larger, better-equipped vessels, reduce mortgage debt on the vessels and
  construct a greater number of vessels than would be possible without the
  program.
