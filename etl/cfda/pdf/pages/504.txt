  This program has maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements; see funding              
  agency for further details. The formula used for allocating funds consists of one   
  data element from the 2000 Census: the number of persons age 16 to 64 with a        
  disability.

  income persons with disabilities for 40 years. Project Rental Assistance            
  Contracts may not exceed 3 years. However, contracts are renewable for up to a      
  one-year term based on availability of funds. Projects are expected to start        
  construction within 18 months of the date of the fund reservation, with limited     
  provision for extensions. Funds will be advanced on a monthly basis during          
  construction.

  Any change in the owner during the 40-year period of the capital advance must       
  be approved by HUD. All owners will be required to submit an annual financial

  counseling from a HUD-approved agency prior to obtaining the loan. Eligible

  insurance premiums will be collected including: (1) an up-front premium
  which may be financed and (2) a periodic premium which is paid monthly. The
  loan origination charge by the mortgagee varies, but the financed portion may
  not exceed the greater of 2 percent of maximum claim amount or $2,000.
  Mortgagors may be charged appraisal and inspection fees in accordance with
  fee schedules established by HUD. These charges may also be financed.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  The mortgage has no specified term. The mortgage is due and payable at the
  death of the borrower(s) or if the borrower sells, conveys, or moves from the
  property.
Reports:

  mortgagees at any time upon request by HUD must furnish a copy of their latest
  financial statement.
Audits:
