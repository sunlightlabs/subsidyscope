EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  The following activities are suggestive and do not limit the range of activities
  considered eligible under this grant program. These activities are eligible when
  they are performed in support of developing and implementing a tribal program
  to manage hazardous waste: Develop and implement codes, regulations, and
  ordinances, policies, and/or guidance to regulate hazardous waste management
  activities and facilities, such as generators, transporters, and treatment, storage
  and disposal facilities. Develop and implement hazardous waste program
  enforcement policies and procedures to ensure regulatory compliance, including
  monitoring and inspection schemes. Develop legal and administrative
  infrastructure adequate to implement and maintain regulatory and/or non-

  Emergency Response Committees (TERC). Identify and assess hazardous waste
  generation and ongoing management of concern to the community, including:
  inventory active and inactive dump/disposal sites and assess contamination
  potential; characterize hazardous waste stream, including illegal dump-sites; and
  identify sensitive sites with potential or actual impacts on water bodies, soil, air,
  cultural/historic resources, threatened or endangered species, etc. Develop and
  implement tribal integrated hazardous waste management plans (including, but
  not limited to, source reduction/recycling, household hazardous waste collection
  programs, pesticide container collection, ). Implement used oil collection/re-use
  and other programs to reduce the mismanagement of hazardous waste in the
  community. Implement household hazardous waste collection events or
  programs that provide sustainable or long-term solutions for disposal of
  household hazardous waste for the community. Develop outreach/education
  documents and other resource materials to plan and conduct hazardous waste
  management seminars for tribal leaders, community members, business and
  civic organizations, etc. Establish qualifications for environmental management
  personnel relative to the tribe=s needs and plan for program implementation.
