  provide support enforcement services to individuals eligible under an approved     
  Title IV-D State plan.

  State Plans and amendments submitted as new State Plans, and Plan

  Federal Financial Participation (FFP) for States and territories is 66 percent of  
  the administrative costs incurred by the State pursuant to an approved Title IV-D  
  State plan. This includes costs incurred by certain court and law enforcement      
  officials pursuant to cooperative agreements with the IV-D agency. Incentive       
  payments are made to States from the Federal share of TANF recoupments.            
  Tribal Child Support programs receive 90 percent Federal Financial                 
  Participation during the first three years of operation of the program.            
  Subsequently, Tribal IV-D programs receive 80 percent. Tribes without a IV-D       
  program, may apply for 100 perent funding to put a IV-D program into place.

  Quarterly financial reports of administrative expenditures and child support       
  collections and annual program reports including caseload data are required by     
  Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE).                                        
Audits:                                                                              
  Periodic audits are made as part of the recipient's systems of financial           
  management and internal control in accordance with Public Law 98-502, the          
  Single Audit Act of 1984. "In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular       
  No. A-133 (Revised, June 27, 2003), Audits of States, Local Governments, and       
  Non-Profit Organizations, nonfederal entities that expend financial assistance of  
  $500,000 or more in Federal awards will have a single or a program-specific        
  audit conducted for that year. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $500,000  
  a year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that       
  year, except as noted in Circular No. A-133." In addition, grants and cooperative  
  agreements are subject to inspection and audits by DHHS and other Federal          
  government officials. OCSE conducts data reliability audits of variables used to   
  compute performance measures. These audits were mandated by The Child              
  Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 (CSPIA).
