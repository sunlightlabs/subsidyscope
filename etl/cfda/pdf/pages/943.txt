  The capital construction fund program is a program created by the Merchant         
  Marine Act of 1970 to help rejuvenate the American Merchant Marine. The            
  assistance provided is not through payment of appropriated funds, but rather       
  allows the fund holder to defer a portion of tax monies that would otherwise be    
  paid to the U.S. Government during the tax year. The extension of tax deferral     
  privileges encourages the accomplishment of the program objective by allowing      
  the fund holder to accumulate and use otherwise taxable earnings for the           
  purposes of acquiring, constructing or reconstructing vessels built and            
  documented in the United States and operated in the United States foreign, Great   
  Lakes or noncontiguous domestic trade and in the fisheries.
