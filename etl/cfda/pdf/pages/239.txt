10.307 ORGANIC AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND
EXTENSION INITIATIVE
   (ORGANIC AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION INITIATIVE)
FEDERAL AGENCY:
  COOPERATIVE STATE RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND EXTENSION
  SERVICE (CSREES), DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
AUTHORIZATION:
  The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, Section 7218, as
  amended; The Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, Section
  1672B, 7 U.S.C. 5925b).
OBJECTIVES:
  Facilitate the development of organic agriculture production, breeding, and
  processing methods. Functionally identify soil microbial communities and ways
  to manage microbial dynamics to enhance nutrient cycling and disease
  suppression; Develop systemic approaches to weed, insect and disease
  management; Prevent, control, and treat internal and external parasites in
  various livestock species; and Breed crops for disease and insect resistance,
  good yield in a biologically diverse system, compatibility with intercrops, good
  response to organic fertility sources, horizontal resistance (traits determined by
  multiple genes). Evaluate the potential economic benefits to producers and
  processors who use organic methods. Analyze potential economic costs, returns
  and risks of organic production systems; Use environmental valuation tools to
  quantify externalities of producing food, and compare externalities of producing
  organic and conventional food; - Analyze price and market structures, including
  ability of small, medium-, and large-scale growers to access different markets, in
  order to frame policies that minimize concentration within the industry; and
  Analyze marketing channels to document how organic food is distributed, what
  share of the organic food dollar is returned to the farmer, and the implications of
  large-scale manufacturers entering the organic market. Explore international
  trade opportunities for organically grown and processed agricultural
