  The Environmental Studies Program currently funds more than a dozen ongoing        
  research cooperative agreements. This cutting-edge research has already and will   
  in the future benefit the public through an increase in understanding the          
  potential impacts of offshore oil and gas and marine mineral and alternative       
  energy activities on the marine environment. Some of the projects underway to      
  improve understanding include: the physical and biological characteristics of      
  offshore borrow areas for sand and gravel for beach and coastal restoration; the   
  reproductive ecology and health of fish assemblages at oil and gas platforms;      
  ecology and health of intertidal communities in proximity to oil and gas           
  production; and the behavior of sperm whales in response to seismic industry       
  activities.

  The MMS ESP funds studies for better understanding of the marine, coastal or       
  human environments affected or potentially affected by offshore oil and gas or     
  other mineral exploration and extraction on the outer continental shelf. Recent    
  efforts include field observations, laboratory experiments and modeling studies    
  of environmental, social, economic, or cultural processes related to offshore      
  OCS gas and oil and marine mineral extraction activities.                          
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:                                                    
  Panels of MMS, and non-MMS scientists (government, public and private sector       
  as appropriate), review and evaluate proposals. Criteria for judging proposals     
  include mission relevance, technical merit, and the quality and appropriateness    
  of the personnel, including past performance and publication record, project       
  management, logistics plan, safety management, permits and interagency             
  coordination, budget/matching funds, and where appropriate, minimization of        
  impacts.
