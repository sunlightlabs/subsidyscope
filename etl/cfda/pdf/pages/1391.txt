  close of the prior plan year, subject to extensions. Certain events that may

  indicate serious problems relating to a plan also must be reported to the PBGC,

  normally within 30 days after the plan administrator or contributing sponsor

  learns of them. Such reportable events include failure to meet minimum funding

  standards; bankruptcy, insolvency or similar settlements; liquidation or

  dissolution; or transactions involving a change of employer. In the case of

  certain privately held companies, the PBGC must be given 30 days advance

  notice of certain corporate or plan events. Controlled groups that have more than

  $50 million in unfunded vested benefits are required to provide plan actuarial

  and company financial information to the PBGC annually. Certain plans are

  required to provide participants annually with plan underfunding information,

  and to certify in the premium filing to the PBGC that they have provided the

  information.

Audits:

  The PBGC determines whether the assets of a covered single-employer plan (that

  has either notified the Corporation of its intent to terminate in a distress

  termination, or against which the Corporation has initiated termination

  proceedings) are sufficient to pay plan benefit liabilities. Title IV imposes

  liability on an employer that terminates an insufficient single-employer plan for

  the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities. The PBGC also audits a statistically

  significant number of single-employer plans terminated in a standard

  termination to ensure that assets were distributed in full satisfaction of all benefit

  liabilities. In addition, the PBGC audits premium filings.

Records:

  Records to support or validate premium payments must be kept for 6 years from

  the premium due date. In addition, records maintenance requirements for
