TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:

  The states have the direct responsibility for establishing and operating their own
  unemployment insurance programs, while the Federal Government finances the        
  cost of administration. State unemployment insurance tax collections are used     
  solely for the payment of benefits. Federal unemployment insurance tax            
  collections are used to finance expenses deemed necessary for proper and          
  efficient administration of the state unemployment insurance laws; to reimburse   
  state funds for one-half the costs of extended benefits paid under the provisions 
  of state laws which conform to the provisions of the Social Security Act and the  
  Federal Unemployment Tax Act; and to make repayable advances to states when       
  needed to pay benefit costs. Funds used for benefit payments may not be used      
  for any program administration costs nor for training, job search, and job        
  relocation payments. Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) is paid out of        
  funds provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).                 
  Benefits for former Federal civilian employees, including postal workers, and     
  former members of the Armed Forces are paid out of the Federal Employees          
  Compensation Account (FECA) in the Unemployment Trust Fund, subject to            
  reimbursement by the former employing agency.
