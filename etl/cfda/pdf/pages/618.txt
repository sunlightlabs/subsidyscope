  Land (AML) reclamation program. Approved programs use grant funds for mine
  site reclamation projects on eligible lands, which are lands and waters mined or
  affected by coal mining processes that occurred prior to August 3, 1977 (as well
  as certain post-1977 and noncoal mining activities). Grants also support project
  administration. Grants may also include funding for AML-related activities
  including: the Emergency program, to abate sudden mining-related dangers to
  public health and safety; the Appalachian Clean Streams program, to treat water
  affected by acid mine drainage; Set-Aside funds, to establish special accounts to
  fund future acid mine drainage treatment or coal mining reclamation; and the
  Subsidence Insurance program, to develop a self-sustaining State subsidence
  insurance program.
Applicant Eligibility:
  The program is restricted to States with (1) an approved coal mining regulatory
  program, (2) lands eligible for reclamation, and (3) active coal mining
  operations within their borders that are paying coal reclamation fees into the
  Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund; and to federally-recognized Indian Tribes
  with (1) eligible lands, and (2) active mining operations paying fees into the
  Fund. An eligible State or Tribe may submit a State reclamation plan to the
  Office of Surface Mining for approval.
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  Coal field citizens and the general public benefit from reduced exposure to
  safety and health risks from abandoned mine lands.
Credentials/Documentation:
  A State or Tribal Indian reclamation plan must be approved by the Assistant
  Secretary for Land and Minerals Management. AML grants to approved projects
  must be approved by an authorized official of the appropriate OSM Regional or
  Field Office.
Preapplication Coordination:
  Preapplication is not required. This program is eligible for coverage under E.O.
  12372, "Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs." An applicant should
  consult the office or official designated as the single point of contact in his or
  her State for more information on the process the State requires to be followed in
  applying for assistance, if the State has selected the program for review.
Application Procedure:
  The standard application SF 424 and forms furnished by the Federal agency and
  required by 43 CFR Part 12, Subpart C, "Uniform Administrative Requirements
  for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments," may
  be used for this program. Please contact the appropriate Office of Surface
  Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) Regional/Field Office for details.
  Grant applications covering all AML programs/activities are to be submitted to
  the applicable OSM Regional/Field Office annually.
Award Procedure:
  The Regional/Field Office should act upon a grant application within 60 days of
  submittal of a complete application. If the application is not approved, the
  Regional/Field Office must set forth in writing the reasons for disapproval and
  may propose modifications if appropriate. The applicant may submit the revised
  application or appropriate revised portions of the application.
Deadlines:
  State/Indian Reclamation Program: Grant application may be submitted at any
  time to the applicable OSM Regional/Field Office. Applications should be
  submitted 60 days prior to the start of the proposed grant performance period.
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:
  Normally 60 days.
Appeals:
  An applicant may appeal the OSM's decision not to approve a grant or to reduce
  or terminate a grant to the Director, OSM no later than 30 days after the
  Regional or Field Office official made the decision.
Renewals:
  New grants may be awarded annually upon satisfactory performance by the
  State/Tribal AML Program.
Formula and Matching Requirements:
  Grants are 100 percent Federally funded. Grant funds are no-year funds
  congressionally appropriated from coal mining reclamation fees in the
  Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. The formula is based on historical coal
  production and annual fee collections. However, States/Tribes may be granted
  additional funds for emergency and other high priority abandoned mine land
  reclamation projects.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  Grant periods are variable; however, under normal conditions, funds for
  construction activities must be expended three years after the award.
Reports:
  State/Indian Reclamation Program (Project Grants): Annual performance and
  financial reports (SF 269) are required.
Audits:
  In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised, June
  27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Nonprofit Organizations,"
  nonfederal entities that expend financial assistance of $500,000 or more in
  Federal awards will have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that
  year. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted
                                                                                  431
