OBJECTIVES:

  To provide hospital insurance protection for covered services to persons age 65      
  or above, to certain disabled persons and to individuals with chronic renal          
  disease.                                                                             
                                                                                       
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:

  Direct Payments for Specified Use.                                                   
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                             
  Hospital insurance benefits are paid to participating and emergency hospitals,       
  skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, and hospice agencies to cover      
  the prospective payment amount or reasonable cost of medically necessary             
  services furnished to individuals entitled under this program.                       
Applicant Eligibility:                                                                 
  Persons age 65 or over and certain disabled persons are eligible for hospital        
  insurance protection. Nearly everyone who reached 65 before 1968 is eligible for     
  hospital insurance, including people not eligible for cash Social Security           
  benefits. A person reaching age 65 in 1968 or after, who is not eligible for cash    
  benefits, needs some work credit to qualify for hospital insurance benefits. The     
  amount of work credit needed depends on age. Hospital insurance (Medicare            
  Part A) is also available to persons, age 65 or over, not otherwise eligible         
  through payment of a monthly premium which is currently $393. A reduced Part         
                                                                                       
  A premium of $216 per month in 2006 is available to persons with 30 or more

  spouse or divorced spouse. The reduction in Part A premium payments would

                                                                                       
  also apply to the surviving spouse, or divorced spouse of an individual who had

  beginning January 1983. Employees who worked prior to 1983 and who were

                                                                                       
  employed during January 1983 can receive credit toward establishing Medicare

  Security-covered positions and hired on or after April 1, 1986 also contribute       
  toward Medicare hospital insurance coverage. Although States may request             
  agreements to cover individuals employed prior to April 1, 1986, no credit is        
  given toward establishing Medicare entitlement for prior employment. Persons

  under age 65, who have been entitled for at least 24 months to Social Security

  disability benefits, or for 29 consecutive months to railroad retirement benefits    
  based on disability, are eligible for hospital insurance benefits.
