OBJECTIVES:                                                                         
  To protect the jobs of American workers; ensure the wages and working             
  conditions of U.S. workers will not be adversely affected by the admission of     
  permanent foreign workers; and assist employers by supplementing the work         
  force with needed skills.                                                         
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                
  Provision of Specialized Services.                                                
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                          
  Under Section 212 (a)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, foreign       
  workers who seek to immigrate to the United States for employment shall be        
  excluded from admission unless the Secretary of Labor determines and certifies    
  to the Secretary of State and to the Secretary of Homeland Security that there are
  not sufficient U.S. workers available for the position, and that the employment   




                                                                               11-08
  of such foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working
  conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed. The certified employer must hire
  the foreign worker as a full-time employee; there must be a bona fide job
  opening available to U.S. workers; job requirements must adhere to what is
  customarily required for the occupation in the U.S. and may not be tailored to
  the worker's qualifications. In addition, the employer shall document that the job
  opportunity has been and is being described without unduly restrictive job
  requirements, unless adequately documented as arising from business necessity.
  The employer must pay at least the prevailing wage for the occupation in the
  area of intended employment.
Applicant Eligibility:
  (1) Any employer who is unable to find qualified U.S. workers to meet his or her
  needs and seeks to hire a foreign worker to fill a given job vacancy on a
  permanent basis is eligible to file an application for permanent labor certification
  with the Department of Labor. (2) An employer who seeks to employ a foreign
  worker whose category of employment is included in the Department of Labor,
  Schedule A list of precertified occupations contained in Part 656, Title 20, Code
  of Federal Regulations is eligible to file an application directly with the
  appropriate U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Office.
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  Employers and foreign workers.
Credentials/Documentation:
  Employers seeking labor certification, and thereafter filing an immigration
  petition to sponsor a foreign worker for employment-based permanent residency,
  must document that worker's education, experience, and job qualifications to the
  satisfaction of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Preapplication Coordination:
  Prior to filing the application for permanent employment certification, the
  employer must request a prevailing wage determination from the State
  Workforce Agency (SWA) having jurisdiction over the proposed area of
  intended employment and must attest, in addition to a number of other
  conditions of employment, to having conducted recruitment prior to filing the
  application. This program is excluded from coverage under E.O. 12372.
Application Procedure:
  Employers must file labor certification applications for permanent employment
  directly with the appropriate National Processing Center (except for Schedule A
  occupations). See http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/foreign/perm.asp for
  additional details.
Award Procedure:
  If the appropriate National Processing Center approves the application, the
  application form is "certified" (stamped) by the Certifying Officer and returned
  to the employer/agent who submitted the application. The labor certification is
  then filed by the sponsoring employer in support of its immigrant worker
  petition with USCIS.
Deadlines:
  None.
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:
  From six months to one year.
Appeals:
  The permanent labor certification program provides for reconsideration by a
  Certifying Officer of denial of an application, upon the employer's request.
  Instead of or following a request for reconsideration, requests for administrative
  review of final determinations (denials of permanent labor certification
  applications) may be made directly to the Department of Labor's Board of Alien
  Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA).
