  sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research and
  development; and to foster and encourage participation of socially and
  economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned small
  business concerns in technological innovation.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Project Grants.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  Project Grants provide funds for salaries, equipment, supplies, travel, and other
  expenses associated with scientific investigation relevant to program objectives.
  NRSAs are made directly to individuals for research training in specified
  biomedical shortage areas, or, to institutions to enable them to make NRSAs to
  individuals selected by them. Each individual who receives a NRSA is obligated
  upon termination of the award to comply with certain service and payback
  provisions. SBIR Phase I grants (of approximately 6-months duration) are to
  establish the technical merit and feasibility of a proposed research effort that
  may lead to a commercial product or process. Phase II grants are for the
  continuation of the research initiated in Phase I and that are likely to result in
  commercial products or processes. Only Phase I awardees are eligible to receive
  Phase II support. STTR Phase I grants (normally of 1-year duration) are to
  determine the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of the
  proposed cooperative effort that has potential for commercial application. Phase
  II funding is based on results of research initiated in Phase I and scientific and
  technical merit and commercial potential of the Phase II application.
Applicant Eligibility:
  Project Grants: Universities, colleges, medical, dental and nursing schools,
  schools of public health, laboratories, hospitals, State and local health
  departments, other public or private institutions, both non-profit and for-profit,
  and individuals who propose to establish, expand, and improve research
  activities in health sciences and related fields. NRSAs: Support is provided for
  academic and research training only, in health and health-related areas that are
  periodically specified by the National Institutes of Health. To be eligible,
  predoctoral awardees must have completed the baccalaureate degree and
  postdoctoral awardees must have a professional or scientific degree (M.D.,
  Ph.D., D.D.S., D.O., D.V.M., Sc.D., D.Eng., or equivalent domestic or foreign
  degree). Individuals must be nominated and sponsored by a public or nonprofit
  private institution having staff and facilities appropriate to the proposed research
  training program. All awardees must be citizens or have been admitted to the
  United States for permanent residence. Nonprofit domestic organizations may
  apply for the Institutional NRSA. SBIR and STTR grants can be awarded only to
