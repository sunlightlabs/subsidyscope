  competitive basis. LEAs must provide an application that describes the needs of     
  homeless students in the school district, including the number of homeless          
  students, the types of services available, and how the LEA will use subgrant        
  funds to serve these students. Typically, subgrants are used for after-school       
  tutoring, purchasing necessary supplies like backpacks, hygiene packs, etc., as     
  well as offsetting the costs of transportation for homeless students wishing to     
  remain in the school last attended prior to becoming homeless.
