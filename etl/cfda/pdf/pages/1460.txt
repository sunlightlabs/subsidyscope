Preapplication Coordination:                                                        
  Not applicable. This program is excluded from coverage under E.O. 12372.          
Application Procedure:                                                              
  Grants: Scientists at universities, medical and dental schools, hospitals,        
  laboratories, and other public or private nonprofit and for-profit institutions.  
  NRSA and career development awards: (1) Nonprofit domestic organizations          
  may apply for institutional awards. (2) Individual candidates or applicants must  
  arrange sponsorship by a public or nonprofit private institution having staff and 
  facilities appropriate to the proposed research training program. (3) All awardees
  must be citizens, or non-citizen nationals of the United States or have been      
  admitted to the United States for permanent residence. (4) To be eligible,        
  postdoctoral NRSA and career development awardees must have a professional        
  or scientific degree (M.D., Ph.D., D.D.S., D.V.M., Sc.D., D.Eng., or equivalent   
  domestic or foreign degree). Institutional applicants must be able to provide the 
  staff and facilities suitable for the proposed research training. SBIR grants can 
  be awarded only to domestic small businesses (entities that are independently     
  owned and operated for profit, are not dominant in the field in which research is 
  proposed and have no more than 500 employees). Primary employment (more           
  than one-half time) of the principal investigator must be with the small business 
  at the time of award and during the conduct of the proposed project. In both      
  Phase I and Phase II, the research must be performed in the U.S. and its          
  possessions. STTR grants can be awarded only to domestic small business           
  concerns (entities that are independently owned and operated for profit, are not  
  dominant in the field in which research is proposed and have no more than 500     
  employees) which "partner" with a research institution in cooperative research    
  and development. At least 40 percent of the project is to be performed by the     
  small concern and at least 30 percent by the research institution. In both Phase I
  and Phase II, the research must be performed in the U.S. and its possessions. To  
  be eligible for funding a grant application must be approved for scientific merit 
  and program relevance by a scientific review group and a national advisory        
  council.                                                                          
Award Procedure:                                                                    
  Grants: All accepted applications competing for grants are reviewed by two        
  advisory groups -- the initial review group composed of nongovernmental peer      
  scientists and the second the National Advisory Dental Research Council. For      
  grants costing less than $50,000, review by a competent staff group may be        
  substituted for Council review. Career development awards and NRSAs: All          
  accepted applications are reviewed by an appropriate initial scientific review    
  group. The Advisory Council provides secondary review of institutional NRSAs      
  and all career development awards. NIDR staff provides expedited secondary        
  review of individual NRSA and small grant applications. All accepted              
  SBIR/STTR applications are evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an     
  appropriate scientific peer review panel and by a national advisory council or    
  board. All applications receiving a priority score compete for available          
  SBIR/STTR set-aside funds on the basis of scientific and technical merit and      
  commercial potential of the proposed research, program relevance, and program     
  balance among the areas of research.
