  receive to operate their TANF programs, needy States may request and receive       
  funds from the Contingency Fund. The Contingency Fund was established for          
  periods when unfavorable economic conditions threaten a State's ability to         
  operate its TANF program. To qualify for Contingency Funds, a State must           
  meet and exceed the Contingency Fund MOE requirement. Under the                    
  Contingency Fund MOE requirement, a State must spend 100 percent of the            
  amount it spent for fiscal year 1994 on AFDC and AFDC-related programs. This       
  amount must be spent in the TANF program to help eligible families. (Some of       
  the State funds spent to meet the TANF MOE requirement may also count              
  toward the Contingency Fund MOE requirement.) Federal Contingency Funds            
  are then available to match (at the applicable Federal Medical Assistance          
  Percentage rate, or FMAP) expenditures made in excess of the Contingency           
  Fund MOE requirement. The State's Federal TANF grant for a fiscal year may be      
  reduced for failure to meet any of 14 different program and fiscal requirements.   
  Most of these penalties may be waived either for reasonable cause or, absent       
  reasonable cause, when the State has an approved corrective compliance plan        
  and the State completely corrects or discontinues, as appropriate, the violation   
  within the period covered by the plan. Beginning in late August 2005, access to    
  the Contingency Fund was expanded for a one year period, through August            
  2006, to States that provided short term non-recurring cash benefits to evacuee    
  families that traveled from the hurricane impacted States of Alabama, Florida,     
  Louisiana, or Mississippi to another State as a result of the hurricane.

Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                               
  States, Territories, and Tribes are awarded their assistance grants in quarterly   
  payments. They may reserve grant moneys, without fiscal year limitation, for

  providing assistance. With certain exceptions, most families are limited to no     
  more than 5 years of assistance under the Federal grant. Tribes have the

  flexibility to establish time limits on receipt of assistance. For Contingency     
  Funds, grant awards are issued monthly to States meeting the eligibility criteria  
  stipulated under Section 101.                                                      
Reports:                                                                             
  States, Territories, the District of Columbia and federally recognized Indian      
  Tribes operating their own Tribal TANF programs are required to collect and        
  report to the Secretary on a quarterly basis case record information on the        
  families receiving assistance. States, Territories, and Tribes are also required to
  report administrative costs and overhead expenditures on programs for needy        
  families, participation by noncustodial parents in work activities, and            
  transitional services provided to former recipients. States and Territories must   
  report child poverty information annually in accordance with a methodology         
  established by the Secretary.                                                      
Audits:                                                                              
  Audits shall be conducted by the Inspector General under Chapter 75 of Title 31,   
  United States Code. If a State or Territory is found to have used funds from the   
  State Family Assistance Grant in violation of the statute, the Secretary shall     
  reduce the grant payable to the State for the immediately succeeding fiscal year   
  by that same amount. For Tribes, the Secretary will have the ability to maintain   
  program funding accountability consistent with generally accepted accounting       
  principles and the requirements of the Single Audit Act of 1984 and OMB            
  Circular A-133.

  States, Territories, and Tribes must maintain records containing information the   
  Secretary may require by regulation.                                               
Account Identification:

  Grants were made to 50 States, the District of Columbia, 3 territories, and 55     
  tribal plans in fiscal year 2007. While the number of grants to States, the        
  District of Columbia, and the territories remains constant, the number of tribal   
  plans has increased each fiscal year. It is estimated that the number of tribal    
  plans will increase to 60 during FY 2008 and to 65 in FY 2009.
