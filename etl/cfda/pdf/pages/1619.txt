  OFA/Regional Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program                 
  managers have authority to approve applications and amendments; disapproval         
  authority is held by the Director of the Office of Family Assistance, in the        
  Administration for Children and Families. Territories contact the Regional          
  TANF program manager for applications for administrative funds. This program        
  is excluded from coverage under OMB Circular No. A-110.                             
Award Procedure:                                                                      
  Once an application is approved, Territories are awarded funds quarterly based      
  on ACF-approved estimates of maintenance assistance and administrative costs.       
  Notification of awards must be made to the designated Territorial agency.           
  Eligible individuals receive monthly subsistence checks from Territorial welfare    
  agencies.                                                                           
Deadlines:                                                                            
  Individuals residing in Guam, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands who are aged,      
  blind, or disabled may apply anytime for this assistance at their local welfare     
  agency.                                                                             
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:                                                   
  Welfare agencies must have a time standard for notifying applicants of

  approval/disapproval; not over 45 days after application, except 60 days for aid    
  to disabled.

Appeals:                                                                              
  Individuals denied assistance must be given a fair hearing on appeal (45 CFR,       
  Chapter 2, Section 205.10). Territorial agencies may request a hearing before the   
  Assistant Secretary for Family Support regarding adverse decisions (45 CFR,         
  Chapter 2, Section 201.14; 45 CFR, Part 16).                                        
Renewals:                                                                             
  The agency must conduct periodic reviews to determine whether conditions            
  justifying eligibility still exist.                                                 
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                    
  Formula and Matching Requirements: Essentially the Federal share of                 
  expenditures for Old Age Assistance, Aid To The Blind, and Aid To The               
  Permanently and Totally Disabled programs is equal to about 75 percent, not to      
  exceed a maximum amount per recipient. However, there is a statutory limit on       
  the total Federal matching or grant payments that Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin      
  Islands and Guam may receive for programs that are subject to this payment          
  ceiling. These programs include the above-named Adult programs, the TANF            
  Program, the Federal Foster Care, Adoption Assistance, Independent Living           
  Programs authorized under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, and the Federal    
  Matching Grant program under section 1108(b) of the Social Security Act. If         
  the Territory has not exceeded its payment ceiling amount for the fiscal year,      
  then the Territory may request and receive Federal matching funds for the above-    
  named Adult programs.                                                               
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                                
  Individuals receive support from the Territorial or local welfare agency until they 
  no longer meet the eligibility requirements.                                        
Reports:                                                                              
  Territory must submit fiscal FSA-231 and statistical reports as required by the     
  Secretary of HHS to ACF. A Treasury Report, TUS- 5104, is required from the         
  States each time funds are drawn and no less frequently than monthly.               
Audits:                                                                               
  Audits are performed by the HHS Office of Inspector General. In accordance          
  with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised, June 27, 2003),             
  "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non- Profit Organizations,"               
  nonfederal entities that expend financial assistance of $500,000 or more in         
  Federal awards will have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that    
  year. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal          
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted    
  in Circular No. A-133. In addition, grants and cooperative agreements are           
  subject to inspection and audits by DHHS and other Federal government               
  officials.

  Territories must maintain records which substantiate eligibility determination      
  and grants that are made.

OBJECTIVES:
  To enforce the support obligations owed by absent parents to their children,
  locate absent parents, establish paternity, and obtain child, spousal and medical
  support.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Formula Grants.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  States and some Tribes provide support enforcement services directly to
  individuals who are receiving federally-funded Foster Care Maintenance
  Payments, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) (or those
  who cease to receive TANF), and to individuals not otherwise eligible for such
  services. TANF, Medicaid, and certain federally-funded Foster Care applicants
  or recipients must have assigned support rights to the State. Non-TANF
  individuals other than those who cease to receive TANF and/or who provide
  authorization to the IV-D agency to continue support enforcement services, must
  have signed a written application for support enforcement services. The State
  must provide services to locate absent parents, establish paternity and enforce
  support obligations.
Applicant Eligibility:
  All States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and Guam.
  Each of these jurisdictions is required to establish or designate a single and
  separate State Child Support Enforcement Agency. Tribes are eligible and we
  currently have seventeen tribal child support programs and 23 in the start-up
  phase.
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  The State must provide support enforcement services to: (1) All applicants for,
  or recipients of TANF, Foster Care Maintenance Payments, and Medicaid, for
  whom an assignment to the State of support rights has been made and who are in
  need of such services; (2) all individuals who cease to receive TANF; (3)
  individuals who provide authorization to the IV-D agency to continue support
  enforcement services; and (4) any other individual who is in need of such
  services and who has applied for them.
Credentials/Documentation:
  The State IV-D agencies must be operating in accordance with an approved Title
  IV-D State plan. Costs eligible for Federal funding will be determined in
  accordance with OMB Circular No. A-87 and 45 CFR 304. Tribes must submit
  a Tribal IV-D application and plan and upon approval receive funding to operate
  a IV-D program.
Preapplication Coordination:
  State officials prepare and review state plans and amendments. Regional Office
  staff are available for consultation or assistance in preparation of State plans and
  amendments. The standard application forms, as furnished by Department of
  Health and Human Services (DHHS) and required by OMB Circular No. A-102,
  must be used for this program. This program is eligible for coverage under E.O.
  12372, "Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs." An applicant should
  consult the office or official designated as the single point of contact in his or
  her State for more information on the process the State requires to be followed in
  applying for assistance, if the State has selected the program for review. High
  level State officials review State Plans and amendments before they are
