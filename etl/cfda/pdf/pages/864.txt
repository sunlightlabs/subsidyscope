17.806 VETERAN'S PREFERENCE IN FEDERAL
EMPLOYMENT
FEDERAL AGENCY:
  OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR VETERANS'
  EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
AUTHORIZATION:
  Veterans Preference Act of 1944, Public Laws 78-359, 93-508, 94-502, 95-520,
  95-454, 97-72, 97-306, 98-543, 99-576, 101-237, 102-16, 102-568, 105-339,
  and 106-117; 109-163; Executive Order 11521, March 26, 1970.
OBJECTIVES:
  To provide assistance to preference eligible individuals who believe that their
  rights under veterans' preference statutes and regulations have been violated.
  Recognizing their sacrifice, Congress enacted laws to prevent veterans seeking
  Federal employment from being penalized for their time in military service.
  Veterans' preference recognizes the economic loss suffered by citizens who have
  served their country in uniform, restores veterans to a favorable competitive
  position for Government employment, and acknowledges the larger obligation
  owed to disabled veterans. Veterans' preference is not so much a reward for
  being in uniform as it is a way to help make up for the economic loss suffered by
  those who answered the nation's call to arms. Historically, preference has been
  reserved by Congress for those who were either disabled or who served in
  combat areas. Eligible veterans receive many advantages in Federal employment,
  including preference for initial employment and a higher retention standing in
  the event of layoffs. However, the veterans' preference laws do not guarantee the
  veteran a job, nor do they give veterans' preference in internal agency actions
  such as promotion, transfer, reassignment, and reinstatement. By law, veterans
  who are disabled or who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during
  certain specified time periods or in military campaigns are entitled to preference
  over others in hiring from competitive lists of eligibles and also in retention
  during reductions-in-force. Preference applies in hiring for virtually all Federal
  jobs, whether in the competitive or excepted service. In addition to receiving
  preference in competitive appointments, veterans may be considered for special
  noncompetitive appointments for which only they are eligible.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Federal Employment.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  To assist persons who perform service in the uniformed services to secure
  Federal employment and to ensure a higher retention standing in the event of a
  reduction-in-force. To provide information and assistance to veterans,
  employers, labor organizations, and other elements of the community concerned
  with veterans' preference in Federal employment and retention. The Department
  of Labor - Veterans' Employment and Training Service investigates complaints
  with the goal of voluntary resolution of veterans' preference problems.
  Unresolved complaints can be pursued by the complainant veteran to the Merit
  Systems Protection Board.
Applicant Eligibility:
  (1) Five-point preference is given to those honorably separated veterans (this
  means an honorable or general discharge) who served on active duty (not active
  duty for training) in the Armed Forces: During any war (this means a war
  declared by Congress, the last of which was World War II); during the period
  April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955; for more than 180 consecutive days, any
  part of which occurred after January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976;
  during the Gulf War period beginning August 2, 1990, and ending January 2,
  1992; for more than 180 consecutive days, any part of which occurred during the
  period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on the date persribed by
  Presidential proclamation or by law as the last date of Operation Iraqi Freedom;
  or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized,
  such as El Salvador, Lebanon, Granada, Panama, Southwest Asia, Somalia, and
  Haiti. Medal holders and Gulf War veterans who originally enlisted after
  September 7, 1980, or entered on active duty on or after October 14, 1982,

  active duty. Effective on October 1, 1980, military retirees at or above the rank
