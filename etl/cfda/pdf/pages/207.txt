OBJECTIVES:                                                                           
  To assist in exploring new market opportunities for U.S. food and agricultural      
  products and to encourage research and innovation aimed at improving the            
  efficiency and performance of the marketing system.                                 
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:

USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                            
  Proposals may deal with barriers, challenges or opportunities manifesting at any    
  stage of the marketing chain including direct, wholesale, and retail. Proposals     
  may involve small, medium or large scale agricultural entities but should           
  potentially benefit multiple producers or agribusinesses. Proprietary proposals     
  that benefit one business or individual will not be considered. Proposals that      
  address issues of importance at the State, regional or national level are           
  appropriate for FSMIP. FSMIP also seeks unique proposals on a smaller scale         
  that may serve as pilot projects or case studies useful as a model for others. Of   
  particular interest are proposals that reflect a collaborative approach between the 
  States, academia, the farm sector and other appropriate entities and stakeholders.  
Applicant Eligibility:
