  State Section 1115 Demonstrations to reimburse affected States for the
  nonfederal share of specified medical care hurricane-related expenditures and
  associated administrative costs, and the total uncompensated care costs for
  affected States. Also, with respect to Katrina hurricane-related affected counties
  or parishes in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, to provide the nonfederal
  share of medical care expenditures furnished to Title XIX and Title XXI
  individuals under existing State plans. In addition, if approved by the Secretary,
  funds may be used by the State to restore access to health care in Katrina
  impacted communities.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:

  (Section 6201(a)(1)&(2) DRA 2005). Under the demonstration projects, costs
  are reimbursable to the State for: the nonfederal share cost of services incurred
  by eligible individuals between August 24, 2005 and June 30, 2006; and the
  total uncompensated care pool (UCCP) costs for services incurred by eligible
  individuals between August 24, 2005 and January 31, 2006. For Hurricane
  Katrina-related affected counties or parishes in Alabama, Louisiana and
  Mississippi, costs are also reimbursable to the State for the nonfederal share of
  expenditures, for medical care only, incurred by Title XIX and Title XXI
