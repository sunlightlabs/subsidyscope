  Section 5302 of Public Law 109-171, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.                
OBJECTIVES:                                                                             
  To provide services in a geographic service area that is, in whole or in part, a      
  rural area that has received a site development grant under this Section.             
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                    
  Project Grants.                                                                       
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                              
  All funds granted should be expended solely for carrying out the approved             
  projects in accordance with Section 5302 of the Public Law 109-171. In the            
  Deficit Reduction Act, a rural PACE provider site is defined as a PACE provider       
  that has been approved to provide services in a geographic service area that is, in   
  whole or in part, a rural area that has received a site development grant under       
  this section. Thus, the statute definition of a rural area as defined in section      
  1886(d)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act states that a rural area would be a          
  county that is not part of a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)(as defined by        
  the Office of Management and Budget) as established for Medicare Inpatient            
  PPS payments.                                                                         
Applicant Eligibility:                                                                  
  This grant opportunity is open to (1) any PACE provider that demonstrates             
  meeting the required definition as set out in the Social Security Act and; (2) is     
  eligible to serve in a rural area as a rural PACE pilot site as defined in the Social 
  Security Act. To meet the qualification of a PACE provider, an applicant must         
  meet the definitions established in sections 1894(a)(3) or 1934(a)(3) of the          
  Social Security Act. The Act defines a PACE provider as being a public or             
  private, nonprofit entity organized for charitable purposes under 501(3)(c) of the    
  Internal revenue code of 1986; and has entered into a PACE program agreement          


1478                                                                              11-08

  with respect to its operation of a PACE program as defined in 1894(a)(2) and
  1924(a)(2) of the Social Security Act. In addition to meeting the definitions of a
  PACE provider, the law also requires that each potential applicant meet the full
  statutory definition of a rural area.

PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) grant program,
  Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) in rural service areas,
  was initiated through the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) and follows the
  New Freedeom Initiative to develop and provide additional care options in the
  community while providing more efficient and coordinated care through
  Medicare and Medicaid. The new Rural PACE Provider Grant Program will
  provide funds to support the coordination of comprehensive care for some of the
  most vulnerable Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries living in rural areas within
  thirteen states across the country. Each site received $500,000 to establish a
  PACE program in their area. CMS awarded the maximum number of grants
  authorized by the DRA to expand patient-based care to a greater number of
  people with Medicare and Medicaid who live in rural areas.
