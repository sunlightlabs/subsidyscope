  A request for proposals (RFP) soliciting applications from eligible communities     
  is issued each year. The RFP can be accessed on the internet through                


                                                                                 11-08
  http://www.grants.gov Additionally, the solicitation is published in the Federal
  Register and served on the Council of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the
  National Governors Association, the National Association of State Aviation
  Officials, the Association of County Executives, the American Association of
  Airport Executives (AAAE), and the Airports Council International-North
  America (ACI).
Award Procedure:
  Applications will be evaluated according to factors established in the RFP and
  under the guidance of the Vision 100-Century in Aviation Reauthorization Act,
  P.L. 108-176.
Deadlines:
  The deadline for filing of proposals is established and specified for each fiscal
  year in the FRP and can vary from year to year. However, the Department
  generally provides grant applicants a minimum of 60 days to submit an
  application.
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:
  Can vary from year to year. However, the target is to awards grants within 120
  days from the established application deadline.
Appeals:
  None.
Renewals:
  Application procedures are repeated each year. However, grant recipients are
  precluded by statute from seeking additional grants in support of the same
  project.
Formula and Matching Requirements:
  This program has no statutory formula or matching requirements. However, cost
  sharing by the grant applicant is highly encouraged and can accord the grant
  applicant priority consideration under certain circumstances set forth in the
  statute.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  The period of time for awards will vary with the complexity of the project.
  Minimum grant duration is one year. The statute limits use of grant funds for air
  carrier subsidy to a maximum period of three years. The same limitation applies
  to other forms of ongoing support for air carrier programs. Financial assistance
  is provided on a reimbursable basis; cash advances will not be made. Funds
  obligated remain available until expended.
Reports:
  Quarterly progress and emplacement reports, and a final report is required.
Audits:
  In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133, Audits of State
  and Local governments, and Nonprofit Organizations, nonfederal entities that
  expend $500,000 or more in a year in Federal awards shall have a single or
  program-specific audit conducted for that year. Nonfederal entities that expend
  less than $500,000 a year in Federal awards are exempt for Federal audit
  Requirements for that year. For direct procurement contracts, audit will be
  conducted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
Records:
  The grant recipient is expected to retain all documents Relevant to the grant
  award for a period of seven years from completion of the project.

Obligations:
  (Grants) FY 07 $8,875,678 $; FY 08 est. $10,000,000; and FY 09 est.
  $10,000,000.
Range and Average of Financial Assistance:
  Range: 2007, $50,000 to $1.0 million. Average: $345,000.
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  Because most grant awards span a period of between two and four years, very
  few projects have reached the end of the grant terms. Of the 30 communities that
  sought new or expanded air service and have filed final reports as of September
  30, 2005, 28 have experienced increased enplanements following the
  implementation of their respective grants. 25 of the 30 communities reported
  reduced passenger leakage to other airports. 16 of the 30 communities
  experienced a reduction in air fares. Furthermore, 26 of the 30 communities
  received improved air service in the form of increased frequencies, larger
  aircraft, or additional air carriers. Of these 26 airports, 19 continue to benefit
  from the improved service following the conclusion of the grant funding.
