  Federal Pell Grant eligibility determinations are based on Part F of the HEA, as   
  amended. This national need analysis formula determines financial eligibility      
  for Federal Pell grants and other Federal student aid and is applied uniformly to  
  all applicants. This formula determines a student's "expected family               
  contribution" (EFC). The fundamental elements of this need analysis formula        
  are the parents' and/or the student's income and assets (excluding home), the      
  family's household size, and the number of family members attending                
  postsecondary institutions. The EFC is determined as the sum of: (1) A             
  percentage assessment of net income (remaining income after subtracting            
  allowances for basic living expenses) and (2) a percentage assessment of net       
  assets, other than a home, (remaining assets after subtracting an asset protection 
  allowance).                                                                        
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                               
  Students are currently limited to one Federal Pell Grant during any award year     
  (July 1 through June 30). There is no funding for students to receive a second     
  Federal Pell Grant during a single award year. Funds for one Federal Pell Grant    
  are usually disbursed at least twice during an award year. Students may only       
  receive a Federal Pell Grant until they have received a bachelor's degree.         
Reports:                                                                             
  Institutions will be required to furnish reports, periodically, on the disbursement
  of funds, as well as to furnish any other reports the Secretary requires. No       
  reports are required of students.

  All records pertaining to the eligibility of each Federal Pell Grant recipient and 
  all fiscal management records must be maintained by the institutions for a period  
  of 3 years or until an acceptable audit has been completed, whichever is later.
