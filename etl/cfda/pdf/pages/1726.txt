  nonfederal entities that expend financial assistance of $500,000 or more in        
  Federal awards will have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that

  All records must be maintained until expiration of 3 years from the date of

  enforcement action, recipients must retain records until the matter is completely  
  resolved.

COMPREHENSIVE BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER
EARLY DETECTION PROGRAMS
FEDERAL AGENCY:
  CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, DEPARTMENT
  OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
AUTHORIZATION:
  Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990, Section 301(a),
  Section 317(k)(3), and Section 1501, Public Law 101-354; 42 U.S.C.241a, 42
  U.S.C. 247b(k)(3), and 42 U.S.C. 300K; Public Law 103-183.
OBJECTIVES:
  To work with official State and territorial health agencies or their designees, and
  tribal health agencies in developing comprehensive breast and cervical cancer
  early detection programs. To the extent possible, increase screening and follow-
  up among all groups of women in the State, tribe or territory, with special to
  reach those women who are of low income, uninsured, underinsured and
  minority, and Native Americans.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Project Grants (Cooperative Agreements).
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  Cooperative agreements funds may be used to assure screening of women for
  breast and cervical cancer as an early detection preventive measure; assure
  appropriate referrals for follow-up services for women with abnormal screening
  tests and routine rescreening; develop and disseminate public education and
  outreach programs for the early detection and control of breast and cervical
  cancers; improve the education, training and skills of health professionals
  (including allied health professionals) in the early detection and control of breast
  and cervical cancers; establish mechanisms through which the States, tribes and
  territories can monitor the quality of breast and cervical cancer screening
  procedures in the State, including the interpretation of such procedures; and
  evaluate program activities through appropriate surveillance and monitoring.
  Cooperative agreement funds may not be expended for screening and follow-up
  services to the extent that payment has been made, or can reasonably be
  expected to be made, with respect to such items or services: (1) under any State
  compensation program, under any insurance policy or under any Federal or State
  health benefits program; or (2) by any entity that provides health services on a
  prepaid basis. Cooperative agreement funds shall not be used for treatment or
  treatment services. States, tribes and territories are required to make available
  nonfederal contributions in cash or in-kind toward such cost in an amount equal
  to not less than $1 for each $3 of Federal funds provided. Such contributions
  may be made directly or through donations from public or private entities. The
  payment for treatment services or the donation of treatment service may not be
  used for nonfederal contributions. States, tribes and territories may include only
  nonfederal contributions in excess of the average amount of nonfederal
  contributions made by the State, tribe or territory for the two year period
  preceding the first fiscal year for which the State, tribe or territory is applying to
  receive a cooperative agreement for a comprehensive breast and cervical cancer
  early detection program. In making a determination of the amount of nonfederal
  contributions for purposes of matching fund requirements, applicants may
  include any nonfederal amounts expended pursuant to Title XIX of the Social
  Security Act for the purpose of screening and follow- up for women at-risk for
  breast and cervical cancers.

  Eligible applicants are the official State health agencies of the United States, the
  District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
  Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the
