OBJECTIVES:

                                                                                       
  To replace part of the earnings lost to dependents because of the worker's death.

  Monthly cash benefits are paid to eligible family members of deceased workers.       
  There are no restrictions on the use of benefits, although the right to future       
  benefits is not transferable or assignable. The Federal government gives the         
  States funds, in advance or by way of reimbursement, for necessary costs in          
  making disability determinations under 20 CFR part 404 subparts P and Q.             
  Necessary costs are direct as well as indirect costs as defined in 41 CFR Part 1-    
  15, Subpart 1-15.7 of the Federal Procurement Regulations System for costs           
  incurred before April 1, 1984; and 48 CFR 31, Subpart 31.6 of the Federal            
  Acquisition Regulations System and Federal Management Circular A-74-4 as

  are the following: widows or widowers age 60 or over; surviving divorced

                                                                                       
  spouses age 60 or over (married to the deceased worker for at least 10 years);

                                                                                       
  disabled widows, widowers or surviving divorced spouses ages 50- 59; widows,

  child under age 16 or disabled and entitled to benefits on the deceased worker's     
  Social Security record; unmarried children under age 18, under age 19 and a full     
  time student in elementary or secondary school; or age 18 or older and under a       
  disability which began before age 22; and dependent parents age 62 and over.         
  All survivors benefits, other than for beneficiaries at full retirement age (FRA) or 
  older, are subject to an earnings test. Beginning with the year 2000, the            
  retirement earnings test was eliminated beginning with the month in which the        
  beneficiary reaches FRA. A person at and above FRA will not have Social              
  Security benefits reduced because of earnings. In the calendar year in which a       
  beneficiary reaches FRA, benefits are reduced $1 for every $3 of earnings above      
  the limit allowed by law, $31,080 in 2005, but this reduction is applied only to     
  months prior to attainment of FRA. For years before the year the beneficiary         
  attains FRA, the reduction in benefits is $1 for every $2 of earnings over the       
  annual exempt amount, $12,000 in 2005. Except for benefits to children and           
  dependent parents, all survivors benefits are subject to a pension offset if the     
  person is also receiving a governmental pension based on his or her own work in      
  non-covered employment. However, the offset does not apply: (1) If the person        
  receives, or is eligible to receive, the pension before December 1, 1982, and can    
  meet the requirements for the Social Security auxiliary's benefit as they existed    
  in January 1977; or (2) if the person receives, or is eligible to receive, the       
  pension before July 1, 1983, and the person was dependent on his or her spouse       
  for at least one-half support at the time the spouse died, became disabled or

  became entitled to Social Security benefits. The amount of the public pension
  used for purposes of the offset against Social Security survivor's benefits is equal
  to two-thirds of the public pension. Benefits for widows/widowers and surviving
  divorced spouses are also offset dollar for dollar by any Social Security benefit
  the surviving spouse receives based on his or her own work. Under certain
  conditions, a lump-sum death payment of $255 is payable to the widow or
  children of the deceased worker. Further, no benefit can be paid to an alien in
  the United States unless he is lawfully present in the United States. Also, an
  alien cannot qualify for benefits if he or she never had a work-authorized Social
  Security Number (SSN) (effective for benefit applications based on SSNs issued
  after 2003).
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  Widows, widowers, and surviving divorced spouses age 60 or over are entitled
  as long as the worker met the insurance requirements. Widows, widowers, and
  surviving divorced spouses also qualify at any age if they have entitled children
  of the worker under age 16 or disabled children in their care; unmarried
  children: under age 18, under age 19 and a full-time student in elementary or
  secondary school or age 18 or older and under a disability which began before
  age 22; and dependent parents age 62 and over. To claim benefits as disabled
  widows, widowers, or surviving divorced spouses, individuals ages 50-59 must
  show that they have a disability that started no later than 7 years after the insured
  died or 7 years after certain other events. "Disability" currently has the same
  meaning for these entitlements as it does for workers who claim disability
  insurance (see 96.001). As in worker disability claims, there is also a 5-month
  waiting period after the disability began before benefits begin and entitlement to
  Medicare after 24 months of entitlement to benefits. Children of the worker
  claiming benefits because of disability are also subject to the definition of
  disability used for workers and must show that they have been disabled since
  before they reached age 22. There is no waiting period for these benefits.
