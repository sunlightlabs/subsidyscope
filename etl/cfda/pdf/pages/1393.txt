  The assistance provided by NARA is designed to assist the public in obtaining     
  access to information contained in records which are in the custody of the        
  National Archives. Restrictions on the use of accessioned records in the National 
  Archives of the United States are divided into two categories: general            
  restrictions and specific restrictions. General restrictions apply to all records 
  regardless of origin and apply to types of information or classes of records      
  exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, for example,         
  national security information. Specific restrictions are specified by the         
  transferring agency or donor and apply only to records in a particular record     
  group or a portion of that record group. All restrictions are included in 36 CFR  
  1256. Access to records in the records center operations within NARA's regional   
  records services facilities; in the National Personnel Records Center; and in the 
  Washington National Records Center is controlled by the agency which created      
  the records.

  To see records in person, NARA Form 14003, Researcher Application, is             
  required. To obtain information or copies by mail, contact the depository; if a   
  form is required, applicant will be notified. The use of publications, such as    
  microfilm publications of the U.S. Census, does not require the completion of a   
  Researcher Application. Microfilm publications are available in regional

  facilities in self-service reference rooms. Request for civilian and military

  personnel records should be addressed to the National Personnel Records Center.

                                                                                    
   Requests for court records should be addressed to the appropriate regional

  of the NARA regional records services facility and in the Washington National     
  Records Center should be addressed directly to the agency having legal custody.
