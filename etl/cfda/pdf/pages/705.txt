  The National Land Remote Sensing Education, Outreach and Research Program           
  has funded projects that assure that all users of remotely sensed data have equal,  
  affordable access to the data and can establish the means to conduct research       
  using the data. Additionally, this program has funded projects focusing on K-16     
  outreach, remote sensing course development for the public, and the tailoring of    
  remotely sensed imagery for State and local scientific and public use.              
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
