OBJECTIVES:                                                                          
  To provide grants and cooperative agreements for biological, economic,             
  sociological, public policy, and other research and administration projects to     
  benefit U.S. fisheries industries and contribute to the economic and social        
  welfare of the Nation; also, to award grants and cooperative agreements to         
  develop innovative approaches and methods for ensuring the safety, quality and     
  integrity of U.S. fishery products; also, to provide funds to the five States      
  bordering the Gulf of Mexico, for projects or other measures designed to           
  alleviate the long-term effects of disasters on the Gulf's fishery resources and   
  associated habitat. To facilitate the administration, coordination and             
  implementation of the research activities of the Cooperative Institute for         
  Fisheries Molecular Biology (FISHTEC). The goal of FISHTEC is to develop,          
  test, and apply new technology in molecular biology for use in management of       
  commercial and recreational marine fisheries. Emphasis of the research program     
  is placed on development of molecular genetics techniques to identify and          
  evaluate the status of fish stocks/populations subject to fishing pressure and/or  
  environmental impacts. To support the implementation of community-based            
  demonstration projects in the U.S. western Pacific that promote the development    
  of fishery-related industries and the economic self-sufficiency of native Pacific  
  islanders and communities.
