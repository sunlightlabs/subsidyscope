OBJECTIVES:                                                                          
  To avoid or substantially minimize industrial strife affecting interstate commerce 
  by providing orderly and peaceful procedures to protect the rights of employers,   
  employees, labor organizations, and the general public, and to prevent unlawful    
  interference with these rights.                                                    
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                 
  Provision of Specialized Services; Investigation of Complaints.                    
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                           
  (1) Determines and implements, through secret-ballot elections, the free           
  democratic choice by employees as to whether they wish to be represented by a      
  union in dealing with their employer and, if so, by which union; and (2) prevents  
  and remedies unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or  
  unions or both. NLRB may seek injunctive relief where a labor dispute results      
  in violence, disruption of employment, or disruption of business relations,        
  potentially in violation of the Labor Management Relations Act. The NLRB           
  does not initiate actions or investigations on its own volition. NLRB processes    
  start only when a covered individual, organization, or employer files an unfair    
  labor practice charge or a petition for an election.                               
Applicant Eligibility:                                                               
  Any covered employer, employee, labor organization, or other person who            
  believes a violation of the Labor Management Relations Act has occurred, or        
  who desires the Board to determine whether a labor organization is to be the       
  choice of employees for purposes of representation, may receive information or     
  assistance. The Act limits the term "employee" to exclude: agricultural laborers;  
  domestic workers; individuals employed by spouse or parent; independent            
  contractors; supervisors (as defined by the Act) and individuals employed by an    
  employer subject to the Railway Labor Act or employed by any person who is         
  not an employer as defined by the Act. The United States Government, State         
  governments, political subdivisions of U.S. and State governments, government      
  corporations (except the U.S. Postal Service), Federal Reserve Banks and

  employers subject to the Railway Labor Act are ineligible employers.
