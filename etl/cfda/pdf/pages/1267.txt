Application Procedure:
  State educational agencies submit applications to the Department of Education
  that meet the requirements of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and
  applicable regulations.
Award Procedure:
  The Department of Education notifies an approved State educational agency of
  its award.
Deadlines:
  Announced annually.
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:
  Approximately three months.
Appeals:
  None.
Renewals:
  None. Applications can be submitted by State educational agencies for a multi-

Formula and Matching Requirements:
  Funds are allocated through a statutory formula based on each State's per pupil
  expenditure and the number of eligible full-time and part-time equivalent
  migrant students aged three through twenty-one residing within the State. In
  determining the full-time and part-time equivalent number of migratory children
  who are in a State during the summer months, the Secretary adjusts the number
  to take into account the special needs of those children for summer and/or
  intersession programs and the additional costs of operating such programs
  during the summer. Beginning in 2003, each State will receive at least 100
  percent of its fiscal year 2002 allocation and any amount in excess of that
  appropriation will be distributed by the formula included above.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  Twelve months. Unspent funds may be carried over into the next fiscal year.
Reports:
  Each SEA receiving funds is required to submit an annual performance report
  that provides information on the number of children identified as eligible for the
  program, characteristics of children served the services provided, and staff.

  Regulations in the Appendix to 34 CFR 80, State and local governments that
  receive financial assistance of $500,000 or more within the State's fiscal year

  between $25,000 and $500,000 within the State's fiscal year shall have an audit
  made in accordance with the Appendix to Part 80, or in accordance with Federal
  laws and regulations governing the programs in which they participate.
