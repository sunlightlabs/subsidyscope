Application Procedure:

  The Department invites each organization authorized by Congress to receive a        
  grant to submit an application for grant funds. The Department provides each        
  invited organization with the required application materials.                       
Award Procedure:                                                                      
  Awards are made to applicants authorized by Congress to receive funds for           
  activities consistent with the authorized use for each grant and with terms of the  
  relevant fiscal year appropriation.                                                 
Deadlines:                                                                            
  There is no deadline for the submission of applications. Applicants are strongly    
  encouraged to submit applications by the end of the calendar year, but              
  applications may be submitted and approved within the time frame for                
  obligation of grant funds, historically three fiscal years.                         
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:                                                   
  Typically, within 4 months of application submission. All applicants are            
  notified in writing of approval. Applications that cannot be approved, either       
  because the proposed activities are not consistent with the authorized use of the   
  grant or the terms of the appropriation; or the organization is not designated by   
  Congress to receive the grant, may require the applicant to seek an amendment
