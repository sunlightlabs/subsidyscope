  Information Center, the National Center on Physical Activity and Disability, the    
  National Paralysis Resource Center, and the National Spina Bifida Information       
  and Resource Center received non-competing continuation funding in fiscal year      
  2008.                                                                               
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                    
  These programs have no statutory matching requirements, however applicants          
  are encouraged to assume a portion of project costs and document such support.      
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                                
  Sixteen State disability and health projects received financial assistance in fiscal
  year 2007 for five year project periods. The competitive research grants funded     
  in fiscal year 2006 had three year project periods. Other future solicitations      
  (when announced) will indicate the length of the project periods and program        
  requirements for each of these programs.                                            
Reports:                                                                              
  Annual progress reports are required. Financial status reports are required no      
  later than 90 days after the end of each specified budget period. Final financial   
  status reports and a final program report is required 90 days after the end of the  
  project. Continuation applications for subsequent budget year financial             
  assistance within these project periods will be submitted by these projects. Non-   
  competing continuation applications will include a progress/performance             
  narrative which outline program accomplishments and operations for that earlier     
  budget period, an upcoming budget year work plan with a detailed narrative and      
  budget justifying the new financial request.                                        
Audits:

  nonfederal entities that expend financial assistance of $500,000 or more in         
  Federal awards will have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that

Range and Average of Financial Assistance:                                            
  The competitive awards using fiscal year 2008 funds for the 6 State capacity        
  projects ranged from $250,000 to $450,000.                                          
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:                                                              
  In fiscal year 2001, CDC supported 14 State projects, 12 research grants, and 3     
  national information centers as noted below. For fiscal year 2007, CDC is now       
  funding 16 States under a 5 year project periods. These 16 States and the new       
  research projects funded in fiscal year 2006 will emphasize the prevention of       
  secondary conditions and health promotion for persons with disabilities and         
  assessing environmental barriers and facilitators to access community programs      
  and services for people with disabilities. The national limb loss information       
  center, the national center on physical activity and disability, the national       
  paralysis resource center, and the national spina bifida information and resource   
  center are providing information and referral regarding these issues. The State     
  projects are expanding program visibility and prominence by building their          
  emphasis on disability and health. This is being accomplished through strategic     
  plans addressing Healthy People 2010 objectives, advisory council and advocacy      
  input, policy development, university and voluntary organization partnerships,      
  data access and analysis, client preventive services and access to care, surveys

  for determining physical limitations among the population, professional and

                                                                                      
  public education, and the inclusion of program evaluation measures. For fiscal

  year 2008, the Research grantees will continue to implement their respective        
  protocols and studies. In fiscal year 2008, the currently funded National Limb      
  Loss Information Center, National Center on Physical Activity and Disability,       
  National Paralysis Resource Center, and the National Spina Bifida Information       
  and Resource Center will continue expansion of their outreach and response          
  capacity to directly support and refer identified needs of persons, providers, and  
  organizations inquiring about these issues of concern. It is expected that all      
  Research grants will be subject to re-competition in fiscal year 2009 based on      
  the availability of funds. The number of such awards will be dependent on that      
  appropriation process.

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  The majority of awards for State capacity projects in the past have been made to
  State health departments and universities with State collaboration to develop a
  statewide focus for the prevention of secondary disabilities and health promotion
  for persons with disabilities within a structured State office, to establish an
  advisory body to guide the development of planning and make recommendations
  to fill gaps in prevention, to establish and build partnerships with universities
  and advocacy/ voluntary organizations for public health surveillance and health
  promotion delivery programs for persons with disabilities, and to conduct
  surveillance and implement community projects in the targeted disability
  domains. Research grantees have accessed data and service programs to identify
  persons with disabilities, conducted surveillance, and implemented studies and
  interventions designed to prevent selected or a range of secondary conditions
  related to cost effectiveness, measurement of participation in the environment of
  persons with disabilities, women, minorities, and adolescents and older citizens
  with disabilities. Current Research grantees include universities and
  rehabilitation hospitals. The National Limb Loss Information Center has worked
  to build, expand, and utilize a national network for providing information,
  referral, and peer counseling programs for persons with limb loss. The National
  Center on Physical Activity and Disability is based at a major research
  university with key collaborating partners in rehabilitation, education, web site
  development and linkages, library capacity, and physical accessibility. The
  National Paralysis Resource Center is developing a comprehensive program to
  address a wide range of service and referral systems. The National Spina Bifida
  Information and Resource Center is developing and evaluating education
  materials and implementing a pilot program to support junior researchers with
  developing competitive research proposals.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
  There was a recent competition for State awards in February 2007. New
  Research projects will be awarded in September 2009. In these cases,
  applications are reviewed based on evaluation criteria explicit in the respective
  Program Announcements. Applications must address demonstrated program
  need, the magnitude of the problem, the management work plan, collaborative
  associations, and the approach toward setting and meeting overall project
  objectives and time frames. These future competitive applications would also be
  evaluated on the capacity of the applicant to demonstrate effective collaborations
  with other agencies and data sources critical to preventing secondary conditions,
  identifying and addressing health promotion needs for persons with disabilities,
  denoting the capability of the project to address minority and low-income
  populations in the prevention of secondary conditions, promoting accessibility to
  all program services for persons with disabilities, and offering sound proposals
  toward development of surveys and surveillance for useful data bases within
  outlined targeted disability activities.
