PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  Approximately 432,800 persons with a reactive test for syphilis received health
  department follow-up. Of those, 50,700 were previously unknown infections
  and were treated. Outreach activities resulted in the examination of
  epidemiologically linked individuals; 19,600 new cases detected and treated,
  43,200 patients preventively treated and 5,100,000 culture specimens were
  obtained from women in gonorrhea screening programs, some 188,200 (3.7
  percent) were positive for gonorrhea of which 152,100 were located and received
  treatment. These gonorrhea screening and other outreach efforts resulted in the
  prevention of an estimated 97,300 new cases of gonorrhea. All project areas
  have established hospital based surveillance efforts for pelvic inflammatory
  disease (PID). Forty-four States have established at least one city or county STD
  program that offers comprehensive surveillance, diagnostic, testing, and
  treatment services for chlamydia. Outreach activities for chlamydia resulted in
  50,700 interviews, 44,500 epidemiologically-linked patients treated and an
  estimated 53,700 additional cases of chlamydia prevented. A total of 65
  applications were reviewed and funded in fiscal year 2007. A similar level of
  effort will continue in fiscal years 2008 and 2009.
