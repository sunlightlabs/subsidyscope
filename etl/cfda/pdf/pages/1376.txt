  amount of the funds it receives directly to LEAs for schools that have been
  identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring to carry out
  activities under Section 1116(b). An SEA may retain up to 5 percent of the
  grant amount received for administration, evaluation, and technical assistance
  expenses. At the LEA level, these funds may be used for any reasonable costs
  associated with carrying out school improvement, corrective action, or
  restructuring activities described in Section 1116(b).
Applicant Eligibility:

  receive funds.

Application Procedure:
  Pursuant to Section 76.140 of the Education Department General Administrative
  Regulations, the Department is requiring States to amend their State plans in
  order to receive Title I accountability funds. The amendment may be brief (less
  than 10 pages) and must describe: (1) the criteria the State will use to determine
  which LEAs, among those eligible, will receive funds; (2) the criteria the State
  will use to determine how much each LEA will receive; and (3) the criteria the
  State will use to ensure that the funds awarded to LEAs will be used to address
  one or more short-term outcome measures to improve student academic
  achievement.
Award Procedure:
  The Department will allocate funds to any State whose submission demonstrates
  that the criteria the State uses to determine which LEA will receive funds and
  how much clearly serve the purpose of carrying out Section 1003(g) of Title I.
Deadlines:
  The Department is in the process of establishing specific guidelines and
  deadlines for States to use in applying for School Improvement Grants.
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:

  sufficient time to ensure that fiscal year 2007 funds for School Improvement
  Grants are awarded prior to September 30, 2008.
Appeals:
  In programs administered by the Department, Section 432 of the General
  Education Provisions Act provides LEAs with a right of appeal when there are
  disagreements between State and local educational agencies, including
  disagreements over funding decisions. Where an LEA alleges that the denial of
  funding is a violation of State or Federal law, rules, regulations, or guidelines
  governing the applicable program, it may, within 30 days, request a hearing
  from the SEA. Once the hearing is held and the SEA issues it written ruling, the
  LEA may appeal a negative ruling to the Secretary.
