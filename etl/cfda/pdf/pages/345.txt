OBJECTIVES:                                                                           
  The Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, Public Law 83-566,               
  established the Watershed Program (16 U.S.C. 1001-1011). Section 6 of the Act       
  provided for the establishment of the River Basin Surveys and Investigation         
  Program (16 U.S.C. 1006-1009). A separate appropriation funded these two            
  programs until fiscal year 1996 when they were combined into a single               
  appropriation, Watershed Surveys and Planning. Public Law 83-566 provides           
  the authority for the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to              
  cooperate with other Federal, State, and local agencies in making investigations    
  and surveys of river basins as a basis for the development of coordinated water     
  resource programs. River basin surveys and floodplain management studies            
  provide local decision-makers with an inventory and analysis of the resource        
  status and trends in their watershed, and the impact this has on the community.     
  It provides them with valuable information allowing them to better understand       
  the cause and effect relationships of changes taking place in their watersheds      
  and communities. Authorities include cooperative river basin studies, floodplain    
  management studies, flood insurance studies, and interagency coordination and       
  program formulation. Reports of the investigations and surveys serve as guides      
  for the development of water, land, and related resources in agricultural, rural,   
                                                                                      
  and urban areas within upstream watershed settings. They also serve as a basis

                                                                                      
  for coordination with major river systems and other phases of water resource

                                                                                      
  management and development. Public Law 83-566 also provides for watershed

  local organizations develop plans on watersheds. The plans describe water

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  (1) Dunloup Creek Watershed, Fayette and Raleigh Counties, West Virginia, is
  well known for its extensively documented flooding problems. In the aftermath
  of devastating floods in 2001, NRCS was asked to find a solution to the
  problem. As a result of extensive investigations, it was revealed that traditional
  structural measures, such as impoundments, levees, and channel modification,
  do not effectively reduce flooding. An alternative solution was developed, with
