  assistance program (TAP) funds in FY 05. Counties qualified in FY 05               
  continues to qualify for TAP through FY 07. The new 3-year grant cycle will        
  begin in FY 08 and ORR will begin the re-qualification process.                    
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                   
  The program provides funding, to the extent of available appropriations, for       
  employment-related and other social services for eligible refugees, asylees,       
  Amerasian immigrants, victims of a severe form of trafficking, and entrants.       
  The formula for allocation is not established in legislation. Funds are distributed
  to States according to a formula which takes into account refugee, asylee,         
  Amerasian, and entrant arrivals in the past five fiscal years. Targeted assistance 
  funds must supplement, rather than supplant existing State and local resources.    
  There is no cost-sharing or matching requirement, however, there is a 60-month     
  limitation on the provision of targeted assistance services for refugees at 45 CFR 
  400.315(b).                                                                        
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                               
  Funds are appropriated on a yearly basis. Payments to States are made through      
  the Payment Management System (PMS).                                               
Reports:                                                                             
  Quarterly expenditure and program performance (and related statistics) reports     
  are provided by the State agency to ORR.                                           
Audits:                                                                              
  In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A- 133 (Revised, June        
  24, 1997), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit                    
  Organizations," nonfederal entities that expend financial assistance of $300,000   
  or more in Federal awards will have a single or a program-specific audit           
  conducted for that year. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $300,000 a      
  year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year,   
  except as noted in Circular No. A-133."                                            
Records:                                                                             
  Separate financial records must be maintained by State agency for 3 years after    
  final payment or of the time period for the particular records in Parts 1-20 of    
  Federal Procurement Regulations, whichever expires earlier.

Obligations:                                                                         
  (Grants) FY 07 $43,731,000; FY 08 $43,731,000; and FY 2009 est                     
  $43,731,000.                                                                       
Range and Average of Financial Assistance:                                           
  TAG awards in FY 07 were in the range of $127,523 to $17,187,504; TAG              
  awards in FY 2008 are estimated to be in the range of $127,000 to $17,000,000;     
  and TAG awards in FY 2009 are estimated to be in the range of $127,000 to          
  $17,000,000.

  In FY 07, 43 grants were awarded. It is anticipated that 42 grants will be         
  awarded in FY 08 and FY 09. For FY 07, ORR reviewed and weighted both the          
  5-year arrival population (FYs 2002 through 2006) for each county and the          
  concentration of refugees within that county to determine its allocation for       
  targeted assistance. FY 07 was the 3rd and final year of the qualification cycle.  
  FY 2008 is the first year of a new qualification cycle. FY 2009 will be the        
  second year of the qualification cycle.

OBJECTIVES:
  To assist State courts in performing their role in the continuum of care provided
  for families and children at risk. It provides State courts with the flexibility to
  design assessments which identify barriers to timely and effective decision-
  making, highlight practices which are not fully successful, examine areas they
  find to be in need of correction or added attention, and then implement reforms
  which address the State courts specific needs. Two new objectives added in
  2005 focus on court-agency collaboration and, direct courts to improve case
  tracking and analysis and 2) increase training of court personnel, including
  cross-training with agency staff. In 2006 an objective was added to require
  assessment and improvement of State courts handling of the interstate placement
  of children.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:

  cross-training with child welfare agency staff and contractors.

  Children's Bureau.
Formula and Matching Requirements:
  Each State court with an approved application is allotted $85,000 for fiscal year
  2007-20011. In addition to this base amount, the remainder of the amount
  appropriated for all State courts ($12,080,287 for fiscal year 2008) will be
  divided among those courts with approved applications according to each State's
  proportionate share of children under the age of 21. If any State courts do not
  apply for their share of these funds, the unclaimed amount will be reallocated
  each year to all other State courts with approved applications. Nonfederal share
  (or match) is required at the rate of 25 percent of the total budget. The same
  formula and match requirements apply to funds appropriated for the two new
  purposes for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 ($20,000,000).
