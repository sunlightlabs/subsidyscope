  agreement for support of research by a named principal investigator. SBIR          
  grants can be awarded only to domestic small businesses (entities that are         
  independently owned and operated for profit, are not dominant in the field in      
  which research is proposed, and have no more than 500 employees). Primary          
  employment (more than one-half time) of the principal investigator must be with    
  the small business at the time of award and during the conduct of the proposed     
  project. In both Phase I and Phase II, the research must be performed in the U.S.  
  and its possessions. To be eligible for funding, a grant application must be       
  approved for scientific merit and program relevance by a scientific review group   
  and a national advisory council. STTR grants can be awarded only to domestic       
  small business concerns (entities that are independently owned and operated for    
  profit, are not dominant in the field in which research is proposed and have no    
  more than 500 employees) which "partner" with a research institution in            
  cooperative research and development. At least 40 percent of the project is to be  
  performed by the small business concern and at least 30 percent by the research    
  institution. In both Phase I and Phase II, the research must be performed in the   
  U.S. and its possessions. To be eligible for funding, a grant application must be  
  approved for scientific merit and program relevance by a scientific review group   
  and a national advisory council.

  that has potential for commercialization and furnish evidence that scientific      
  competence, experimental methods, facilities, equipment, and funds requested       
  are appropriate to carry out the plan. Grant forms PHS 6246-1 and PHS 6246-2       
  are used to apply for SBIR Phase I and Phase II, respectively. Grant forms PHS     
  6246-3 and PHS 6246-4 are used to apply for STTR Phase I and Phase II,

  The NIH is in the process of a transition to fully electronic grant submission     
  through Grants.gov (see http://era.nih.gov/ElectronicReceipt for details).         
  Depending on the grant mechanism, either form PHS-398 (Rev. September              
  2004) or form SF424(R&R) (October 2005) is the standard form. Both can be          
  obtained at http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/forms.htm. The standard application      
  forms, as furnished by PHS and required by 45 CFR, Part 92 for State and local     
  governments, must be used for this program. This program is subject to the         
  provisions of 45 CFR, Part 92 for State and local governments and OMB              
  Circular No. A-110 for nonprofit organizations, as appropriate. SBIR and STTR      
  Grant Solicitations and SBIR Contract Solicitation may be obtained                 
  electronically through the NIH's "Small Business Funding Opportunities" home       
  page at www.nih.gov/grants/funding/sbir.htm on the World Wide Web. The             
  Solicitations include submission procedures, review considerations, and grant      
  application or contract proposal forms. All competing SBIR and STTR grant          
  applications must be submitted electronically via Grants.gov The following is a    
  website address for NIH electronic submission of grant application information:

Award Procedure:                                                                     
  Approved grants and cooperative agreements are funded based on scientific          
  merit, program relevance, and program balance and are made annually. Initial       
  award provides funds for the first budget period (usually 12 months) and Notice    
  of Grant Award (Form PHS 1533) indicates support recommended for the               
  remainder of the project period, allocation of Federal funds by budget categories, 
  and special conditions, if any. All accepted SBIR/STTR applications are            
  evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate scientific peer     
  review panel and by a national advisory council or board. All applications         
  receiving a priority score compete for available SBIR/STTR set-aside funds on      
  the basis of scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the        
  proposed research, program relevance, and program balance among the areas of       
  research.
