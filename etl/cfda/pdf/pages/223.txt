  An example of program accomplishments: One university developed a course           
  entitled, "Biotechnology: Science and Socio-Economic Issues" presented in two      
  formats: as a traditional on-campus lecture class for undergraduates and as an     
  innovative distance education course. The course introduces genetic engineering    
  and the basic scientific theory of biotechnology in animal, plant, food, and       
  economic research, and the latest applications of biotechnology in agriculture     
  production.
