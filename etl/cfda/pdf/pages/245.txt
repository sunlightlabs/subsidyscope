  at basic rents comparable to those if RHS provided full financing, computed as a
  percentage of the RHS total development cost. A minimum of ten percent
  leveraged assistance is required to earn points; however, less than ten percent
  and the proposal includes donated land, two points will be awarded for the
  donated land, (0 to 20 points); (2) Seasonal, temporary, migrant housing (5
  points for up to and including 50 percent of the units; 10 points for 51 percent or
  more); For FY 2005, National Office initiative will be based on the presence of
  and extent to which a tenant services plan exists that clearly outlines services
  that will be provided to the residents of the proposed project. Two points will be
  awarded for each resident service included in the tenant services plan up to a
  maximum of 10 points,(0 to 10 points). Application selection process: (1) States
  will review and score the applications and submit a list of applications in rank
  and point score order to the National Office; (2) the National Office will rank
  applications on a nation-wide basis and will advise States of the results.
Deadlines:
  Please contact the program contact listed in the Information Contacts section
  below.
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:
  RHS uses a two-stage application process for the Farm Labor Housing Program.
  First, applicants submit preapplications, which are used to determine
  preliminary eligibility and feasibility. RHS then invites some applicants to
  submit formal applications. Section 514/516 funds are divided between off-farm
  housing and on-farm housing. The off-farm program provides loans and grants
  to organizations that assist farmworkers at off-farm locations with no restrictions
  that workers be employed on a particular farm. Under new regulations effective
  June 1999, preapplications for the off-farm program funds must be submitted in
  response to a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published in the Federal
  Register every year. RHS scores the preapplications, using a ranking process to
  determine which applicants will be invited to submit formal applications. The
  on-farm program makes loans to eligible farmers (or a group of farmers) to
  provide Housing, usually for their own laborers. Preapplications for on-farm
  units, or for repair And rehabilitation of existing off-farm units, may be
  submitted at any time are processed on a first-come, first-served basis.
Appeals:
  A person or organization who is directly and adversely affected by an
  administrative decision by Rural Development should follow the procedures
  found in 7 CFR Part 1900, Subpart B of "Rural Development Administrative
  Appeal Procedures."
Renewals:
  Not applicable; although, applicants may apply under subsequent funding
  cycles.
Formula and Matching Requirements:
  In case of a grant, 10 percent or more of the total development cost must be
  obtained from other sources. This may include funds made available through
  the power to levy taxes, assessments or charges, or from other credit sources
  including an Rural Development Labor Housing loan under Section 514.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  Loans are usually made for 33 years at 1 percent interest. Grants may cover up
  to 90 percent of development cost. The balance may be (and usually is) a Section
  514 loan. RHS rental assistance (RA) subsidy can be used to limit tenant
  payments to 30 percent of their income. RA can be used as an operating subsidy
  for projects or units with Section 516 funding that serve migrants. It is RHS
  policy to attempt to use less than a 90 percent grant when RA is utilized.
Reports:
  Monthly progress reports are to be made to the Rural Development District/State
  Offices during the first year of operation or until requirement is waived by Rural
  Development.
Audits:
  For borrowers not covered under OMB Circular No. A-133, annual audits are
  required from borrowers with 25 or more units in one or more projects. In
  accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR Part 3052, which implement OMB
  Circular No. A-133 (Revised, June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local
  Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations," nonfederal entities that receive
  financial assistance of $500,000 or more in Federal awards will have a single or
  a program-specific audit conducted for that year. Nonfederal entities that
  expend less than $300,000 a year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal
  audit requirements for that year, except as noted in 7 CFR 3052.
Records:
  Adequate operating tenant, and accounting records must be maintained by
  borrower.
