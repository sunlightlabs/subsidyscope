  Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Section 108 as amended.             
OBJECTIVES:                                                                          
  To provide communities with a source of financing for economic development,        
  housing rehabilitation, public facilities, and large scale physical development    
  projects.                                                                          
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                 
  Guaranteed/Insured Loans.                                                          
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                           
  For purposes of determining eligibility, the Community Development Block           
  Grant (CDBG) rules and requirements apply. As with the CDBG program, all           
  projects and activities must either principally benefit low- and moderate-income   
  persons, aid in the elimination or prevention of slums and blight, or meet urgent  
  needs of the community. The President's FY 2009 budget proposes to combine         
  several categorical programs, including the Section 108 program, into the CDBG     
  program.                                                                           
Applicant Eligibility:                                                               
  Eligible Applicants include: metropolitan cities and urban counties, i.e., CDBG    
  entitlement recipients; nonentitlement communities that are assisted in their      
  submission of applications by States that administer the CDBG program;             
  nonentitlement communities eligible to receive CDBG funds under the HUD-           
  Administered Small Cities CDBG program; and Insular Areas (American                
  Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands). The public         
  entity may be the borrower or it may designate a public agency to be the           
  borrower. Furthermore, HUD's FY 2008 appropriations act authorizes HUD to          
  provide loan guarantees to States borrowing on behalf of local governments in      
  nonentitlement areas.                                                              
Beneficiary Eligibility:                                                             
  The principal beneficiaries are low and moderate income persons.                   
Credentials/Documentation:                                                           
  Costs will be determined in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-87 for State        
  and local governments.                                                             
Preapplication Coordination:                                                         
  Preapplication requirements are found in 24 CFR Section 570.704.                   
  Presubmission requirements are similar to those applicable for the Community       
  Development Block Grants program. Proposed activities must be consistent with      
  a unit of local government's Consolidated Plan submitted for HUD's Community       
  Planning and Development Programs. This program is eligible for coverage           
  under E.O. 12372, "Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs." An               
  applicant should consult the office or official designated as the single point of  
  contact in his or her State for more information on the process the State requires 
  to be followed in applying for assistance, if the State has selected the program   
  for review.                                                                        
Application Procedure:                                                               
  Application requirements are found in 24 CFR Section 570.704.                      
Award Procedure:                                                                     
  Upon approval of an application, HUD will issue to the applicant an offer of

  commitment to guarantee notes or other obligations issued by the applicant or      
  its public agency designee. The commitment will be subject to compliance with      
  applicable requirements and such conditions as HUD may specify in the

  commitment document. Furthermore, borrowers are required to pledge current         
  and future CDBG funds as security for the loan guarantee. HUD also requires        
  that the loan guarantee be secured with other collateral.                          
Deadlines:                                                                           
  None; applications can be submitted at any time.                                   
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:                                                  
  Approximately 75 days from submission of complete application to appropriate       
  HUD Field Office.                                                                  
Appeals:                                                                             
  None.                                                                              
Renewals:                                                                            
  Not Applicable.                                                                    
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                   
  Formula and Matching Requirements: Section 108 has no matching requirement         
  but Section 108 funds (like CDBG funds) may be used as local matching funds        
  for most other Federal programs. Maximum commitment amounts are limited as         
  follows: Entitlement Public Entities an entitlement public entity may apply for    


336                                                                            11-08

  up to five times the public entity's latest (approved) CDBG entitlement amount,
  minus any outstanding Section 108 commitments and/or principal balances on
  Section 108 loans; State assisted public entities a nonentitlement public entity
  may apply for up to five times the latest (approved) CDBG amount received by
  its State, minus any outstanding Section 108 commitments and/or principal
  balances on Section 108 loans for which the State has pledged its CDBG funds
  as security; and Nonentitlement public entities eligible under the HUD
  administered Small Cities Program in Hawaii and Insular Areas, the maximum
  commitment amount is five times the public entity's latest grant under Subpart F
  of 24 CFR Part 570, minus any outstanding Section 108 commitments and/or
  principal balances on Section 108 loans.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  The maximum repayment period for a Section 108 loan is twenty years.
  Repayment schedules and forms are negotiable.
Reports:
  The reporting requirements for Section 108 are the same as the reporting
  requirements for the CDBG program.
Audits:

  and Local governments and Nonprofit Organizations," nonfederal entities that
  expend financial assistance of $500,000 or more in Federal awards will have a
  single or a program-specific audit conducted for that year. Nonfederal entities
  that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal
  audit requirements for that year, except as noted in Circular No. A-133.

  The record keeping requirements of Subpart J of 24 CFR Part 570 apply to
  entitlement public entities receiving grants under Subpart F of 24 CFR Part 570.
