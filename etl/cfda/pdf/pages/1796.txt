CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:

  The selection criteria are primarily based on the benefit to navigation and the

  cost of alteration of the obstructive bridge. The following Criteria are used to  
  determine if a bridge is obstructive under the Truman Hobbs Act: The District     
  Commander receives complaints that a bridge is obstructive to navigation, or he   
  can initiate an investigation because of numerous accidents. Through informal     
  discussions with the complainant and other affected and or concerned parties, if  
  sufficient information is available, the District Commander may formulate an      
  opinion on whether or not the bridge in question is an unreasonable obstruction   
  to navigation. If the District Commander determines that further investigation is 
  not warranted, the District Commander informs the complainant there is not        
  enough evidence to warrant an investigation and takes no further action. If the   
  District Commander concludes that the bridge could be an unreasonable             
  obstruction to navigation, the District Commander conducts a Preliminary          
  Investigation, which involves: analyzing the existing bridge to determine if the  
  navigational clearances are restrictive and to what extent; describing the        
  waterway in the vicinity of the bridge (with charts of the area) for the record to
  establish, area and location of bridge in question, and any naturally occurring   
  aspects of the environment which may impact navigation; collecting data on        
  bridge openings to establish amount of use, accidents attributed to restrictive   


                                                                               11-08
  navigational clearances and not pilot error, all costs associated with accidents as
  described above, and other costs associated with the need to alter for the benefit
  of navigation (i.e., the cost of double tripping); computing the navigation
  benefits; and recommending a course of action. A Preliminary Investigation
  Report is sent to the Commandant for review. If the Commandant determines
  that the bridge is not an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the
  Commandant then notifies the District Commander that the bridge does not
  qualify for alteration under the Truman-Hobbs Act and no further action is
  required. The case may be reopened if changes in navigation occur. If the
  Commandant determines that the bridge may be an unreasonable obstruction to
  navigation, the Commandant then directs the District Commander to conduct a
  detailed investigation. The purpose of the investigation is to gather additional
  facts to determine if the bridge is indeed an unreasonable obstruction to
  navigation, what clearances are needed, and any other circumstances that need
  disclosing. The District Commander forwards a Detailed Investigation Report to
  the Commandant. The report contains detailed information and substantiated
  data collected during the investigation in support of the recommendation. The
  Commandant reviews the Detailed Investigation Report and conducts a
  Benefit/Cost Analysis. The Commandant then determines if the benefit to
  navigation which will result from the alteration is at least equal to the cost of
  making the bridge alterations. If the benefit does not at least equal the cost then
  the bridge can not be altered under the Truman-Hobbs Act. The Navigation
  Benefit is used to calculate the Benefit-to Cost Ratio (B/C). The B/C will be
  used to determine eligibility under the Truman-Hobbs Act and to justify for
  funding before Congress. The Navigational Benefits generally will be calculated
  in three categories, namely: (1) Vessels delays resulting from limited clearances
  of the bridge (or Transit Time Savings, resulting from a reduction in transit time
  and thus operating expenses in clearing the bridge zone); (2) Collision damage
  resulting from accidents caused by the limited clearance of the bridge (or Water
  Accident Reduction Savings, due to elimination/reduction of future damages to
  the bridge, fenders, and vessels); and (3) Certain other savings have been
  eliminated. Examples of these savings are elimination of a need
  forextrapilots, crew, and tugs; elimination of environmental delays such as tide,
  wind, currents darkness, visibility directly attributable to the limited clearance of
  the bridge itself; and increase in trips, because the restrictive bridge clearance
  that had heretofore prohibited the use of larger barge and/or tows. The Benefit-
  to-Cost Ratio is computed and is the indicator to determine if a bridge is an
  unreasonable obstruction to navigation alterable under the Truman-Hobbs Act. If
  the Commandant concludes that the bridge does not qualify for alteration under
  the Truman-Hobbs Act, the Commandant notifies the District Commander that
  the bridge does not qualify and no further action is required. However the case
  may be reopened with additional information if the Commandant determines
  that the bridge is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, and qualifies for
  alteration under the Truman-Hobbs Act. The Commandant notifies the District
  Commander to inform the bridge owner of the required changes. The bridge
  owner is given 60 days to reply. When the reply is received or when the 60 days
  are up, the Commandant issues the order to alter. The District Commander
  prioritizes investigations of possible obstructive bridges based upon a variety of
  relevant factors. The factors taken into account are type of bridge, location of
  bridge, cross current, accident history of the bridge, traffic density, duration of
  channel blockage and time to reopen, severity of damage resulting from
  accidents, type and amount of cargo transiting through the bridge, risk of the
  bridge being hit and savings due to avoidance of collision risk, economic impact
  to navigation industry, possible environmental consequences that may result
  from an accident and benefits to navigation. Priorities are continuously reviewed
  and updated by bridge division at Headquarters. Inter-district priority for the
  alteration of bridges is established by Headquarters. Priority is based on the
  severity of impacts attributable to each bridge. Priorities are updated as new
  bridges come to the District Commander's attention and as new information
  becomes available that require changes in priorities.
