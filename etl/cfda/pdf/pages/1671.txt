  hospital insurance and already receiving benefits from Social Security or the

  Certain individuals may enroll during a special enrollment period (SEP) if they   
  are covered under a group health plan (GHP) when first eligible to get Medicare:

  (1) individuals age 65 or older who are covered under a GHP based on their own    
  or a spouse's current employment; and (2) disabled individuals under age 65

  who are covered under a GHP based on their own or any family member's             
  current employment. If the coverage of disabled individuals under age 65 was      
  not through a large group health plan (LGHP), that is, a plan that covers         
  employees of at least one employer that normally employs at least 100             
  employees, no family member other than a spouse qualifies for a special           
  enrollment period. An SEP enrollment may occur during any month the               
  individual is covered under the GHP based on current employment or, during the

  surcharge. Individuals may also enroll during the General Enrollment Period       
  (FGEP) that takes place January through March of each year. SMI Part B            
  coverage begins July 1 of the year individuals enroll. There is a 10 percent      
  premium surcharge for each full 12-month period a person could have been          
  enrolled but was not in SMI Part B.
