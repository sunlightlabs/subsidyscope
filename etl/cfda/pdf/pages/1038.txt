  Loans made to homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and nonprofit

  all applicants to determine interest rate. Loans to homeowners/tenants are made
  for up to 30 years. Limit of $200,000 for repair/replacement of real property;
  $40,000 for repair/replacement of personal property. The loan limit may be
  increased by 20 percent to provide protective measures from damages caused by
  physical disasters. The interest rate for homeowners/tenants who have credit
  available elsewhere is determined by a formula based on the cost of money to the
  U.S. Government, but not to exceed 8 percent. The interest rate for
  homeowners/tenants who do not have credit available elsewhere is one-half of
  the formula rate, but not to exceed 4 percent. Loans to business may not exceed

  maturities not to exceed 3 years. For nonprofit organizations determined to be
  able to obtain credit elsewhere, the interest rate is based on a statutory formula,
  with maturities not to exceed 30 years. For businesses and nonprofit
  organizations determined to be unable to obtain credit elsewhere, the interest
  rate may not exceed 4 percent, with maturities up to 30 years. Under certain
  circumstances, homeowners and businesses may be eligible for refinancing of
  existing liens. There are statutory restrictions on the use of funds for voluntary
  relocation. In the case of a Major Source of Employment, the $1,500,000
