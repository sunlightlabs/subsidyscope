FEDERAL AGENCY:
  OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS, BUREAU OF JUSTICE ASSISTANCE,
  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
AUTHORIZATION:
  Omnibus Appropriations Act, Public Law 106-113, Division B, Section 1000(a);
  Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252, Section 242 as Amended; Title
  II, subtitle C, Section 20301; Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act
  of 1994, Public Law 103-322.
OBJECTIVES:
  The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) is a payment program
  designed to provide federal assistance to states and localities that incur costs for
  incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens who are being held as a result of
  state and/or local charges or convictions. BJA administers this program in
  conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Immigration
  and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
  Services branches.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Direct Payments with Unrestricted Use.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  The Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-162,
  Title XI) included the following requirement regarding the use of SCAAP funds:
  "Amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations in
  paragraph (5) that are distributed to a State or political subdivision of a State,
  including a municipality, may be used only for correctional purposes."
  Beginning with FY 2007 SCAAP awards, all funds must be used for correctional
  purposes only. To be eligible for reporting, inmates must have been convicted of
  a felony or second misdemeanor for violations of state or local law, and housed
  in the applicant's state or local correctional facility for 4 or more consecutive
  days during the reporting period. Once a person meets these criteria, all pre-trial
  and post-conviction time served from July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006 may
  be included in the FY 2007 application. Salary information reported in the
  SCAAP application must reflect the total salaries and wages paid to full and
  part-time correctional officers and others who meet the SCAAP definition. See
  the FY 2007 SCAAP Guidelines at
  http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/BJA/grant/2007_SCAAP_Guidelines.pdf.
Applicant Eligibility:
  Eligible applicants include States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam,
  the Virgin Islands and localities or local jurisdictions exercising authority with
  respect to the incarceration of an undocumented criminal alien. This covers state
  prison facilities (including those housing juveniles convicted as adults of felony
  offenses or two or more misdemeanors) and local jails, whether operated by
  counties or cities. Applicants are generally State and units of local government.
  Note: Only one application is accepted from each separate political division (i.e.,
  State, county, city).
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and
  localities or local jurisdictions.
Credentials/Documentation:
  Applicants who are seeking funding must complete an electronic application
  form via the Office of Justice Programs Grant Management System (GMS). The
  authorized official certifies compliance with all SCAAP requirements, including
  that: the applicant has been authorized by the Chief Executive Officer of the
  applicable unit of government; the inmate identifiers required have been
  submitted to BJA in the proper format(s) for the Department of Homeland
  Security's (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S.
  Citizenship and Immigration Services verification within the prescribed
  deadlines; all inmates counted by the applicant have been convicted of either a
  felony or two misdemeanor offenses under the applicant's law; and, only salary
  costs for corrections officers were included in the Total Salary Costs. By
  certifying on-line, the authorizing signing official is also assuring that all federal
  certifications and assurances are being met. The certification and assurance
  forms (Assurances, OJP Form 4000/3 and Certifications Regarding Lobbying;
  Debarment, Suspension and Other Responsibility Matters; and Drug-Free
  Workplace Requirements, OJP Form 4061/6) are provided on-line to allow
  applicants to review and accept them electronically.
Preapplication Coordination:
  No formal preapplication coordination is required. While informal
  preapplication coordination is not required, it is encouraged that applicants
  coordinate with any facilities for which they have responsibility to detain or
  incarcerate undocumented criminal aliens. This program is excluded from
  coverage under E.O. 12372 "Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs."
Application Procedure:
  SCAAP applications are administered via the Office of Justice Programs
  Internet-based Grants Management System. Inmate data, including the proper
  inmate identifiers, may either be manually key-stroked into the on-line
  application system, or submitted on-line by electronically attaching the
  applicable portions of their inmate databases. Awards are announced after the
  Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services inmate
                                                                                       599
