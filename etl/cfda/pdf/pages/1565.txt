  to individuals selected by the training program director at the institution.        
  Support is available for both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees and will        
  include an amount for institutional expenses. Indirect costs may be requested at    
  8 percent of total direct costs, exclusive of tuition and related fees and          
  expenditures for equipment, or actual indirect costs, whichever is less.            
  Postdoctoral students receiving fellowships or stipend support under either         
  individual or institutional grants for 12 months or less are obligated to pay back  
  this support through an equivalent period of continued postdoctoral training or a   
  period of health related research and/or teaching activities after the completion   
  of their training. Postdoctoral individuals in their thirteenth and subsequent      
  months of support will incur no further obligation, and such support will be        
  considered acceptable postdoctoral payback service. Annual FY 08 stipend            
  levels will be $20,772 for predoctoral awards and $36,996 to $51,036 for            
  postdoctoral awards dependent upon the number of years of relevant                  
  postdoctoral experience. Research training support may not be used for              
  internships or other clinical training. COR Honors Undergraduate institutional      
  training grants are designed to increase the number of well-prepared students       
  from institutions with substantial minority enrollments who can compete             
  successfully for entry into Ph.D. programs relevant to the mission of the NIMH.     
  Stipends of $10,956 per year may be requested for each full-time, junior/senior     
  level trainee and other related institutional costs may be requested as described   
  in the applicable program announcement.
