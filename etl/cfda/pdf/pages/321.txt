  An entity that receives an Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) loan from the        
  Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS) is referred to as an intermediary.          
  Intermediaries must relend all of the loan funds received from the IRP loan for      
  business facilities or community development in rural areas. An entity that          
  receives a loan from an intermediary is referred to as an ultimate recipient. The    
  maximum loan to any one intermediary is $2 million. The maximum term is 30           
  years and the interest rate is one percent per annum. Intermediaries may not use     
  IRP funds to finance more than 75 percent of the cost of an ultimate recipient's     
  project or for a loan of more than $250,000 to one ultimate recipient. (No more      
  than 25 percent of an IRP loan approved may be used for loans to ultimate            
  recipients that exceed $150,000.)

  Intermediaries must have adequate legal authority and a proven record of             
  successfully assisting rural businesses and industries. Ultimate recipients must     
  not be located within a city with a population of 25,000 or more. Both               
  intermediaries and ultimate recipients must be unable to obtain the loan at          
  reasonable rates and terms through commercial credit or other Federal, State, or     
  local programs. This program is excluded from coverage under OMB Circular
