  Reorganization Plan No. 1, 1978, 29 U.S.C. 621 et seq; Civil Rights Act of
  1991, Public Law 102-166.
OBJECTIVES:
  To prohibit age discrimination in hiring, advancement in employment, terms and
  conditions, and other employment practices, promote the employment of older
  workers based on ability rather than age, and help employers and employees find
  ways to meet problems arising from the impact of age on employment.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Advisory Services and Counseling; Investigation of Complaints.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  Individuals 40 years of age and older are protected from age discrimination by
  private employers who have 20 or more employees, by Federal and local
  governments, by employment agencies and by labor organizations. It is unlawful
  for employers, employment agencies, or labor organizations to use
  advertisements indicating any preference, limitation, specification, or
  discrimination based on age. Exceptions to the Act's provisions are provided
  where age is a bona fide occupational qualification, the differentiation is based
  on reasonable factors other than age or if an otherwise prohibited practice is in
  observance of the terms of a bona fide seniority system or employee benefit plan
  (except that no such seniority system or employee benefit plan shall excuse the
  failure to hire, or require or permit the involuntary retirement of any individual).
   Exemptions are provided for the mandatory retirement of bona fide executive
  and high policy making employees 65 years of age and older who are entitled to
  at least $44,000 a year from a retirement plan. Some maximum hiring ages and
  mandatory retirement are permitted for police and firefighters. The EEOC may
  establish such reasonable exemptions as it may find necessary and proper in the
  public interest. Charges of discriminatory employment practices by or on behalf
  of an individual or group of individuals claiming to be aggrieved are received.
  Mediation of the dispute may be offered. If mediation is not used or is not
  successful, investigations ensue and if reasonable cause is found, the charge is
  conciliated. If conciliation proves to be unsucessful the Commission may bring
  a civil action against respondent(s) named in the charge.
Applicant Eligibility:
  Individuals age 40 and over who believe that they have been discriminated
  against because of age or who believe that such discrimination is occurring
  against others 40 and over.
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  Individuals age 40 and over.
Credentials/Documentation:
  None.
Preapplication Coordination:
  None. This program is excluded from coverage under E.O. 12372.
Application Procedure:
  A charge may be filed by any aggrieved individual or by any organization, i.e.
  labor union, association, legal representative, etc., either as an aggrieved entity
  or on behalf of an aggrieved individual. Charges may be filed either by mail or
  in person at the appropriate field office of the EEOC. (The names of persons
  making inquiries are held in confidence if requested.)
Award Procedure:
  A charge is sufficient when the Commission receives from the person making
  the charge a written statement sufficiently precise to identify the parties and to
  describe generally the action or practices complained of.
Deadlines:
  Individuals who wish to assert their rights under the Age Act must file a charge
  with the Commission or its designated agent within 180 days of the alleged
  discriminatory action (or in a case where the alleged discrimination occurs in a
  State which has its own age discrimination law, within 300 days of the alleged
  discriminatory action, or 30 days after receipt of notice of termination of State
  proceedings, whichever is earlier). A civil action may be commenced at any
  time 60 days after a charge has been filed with the EEOC. When EEOC
  completes its investigation without obtaining relief for persons covered by a
  charge, covered persons will be given written notice of their right to sue. A civil
  action may be brought within 90 days after the date of the receipt of such notice.
