  - Fiscal Year 2008: The Environmental Programs Assistance Act of 1984 (Public      
  Law 98-313) authorized the Administrator of the EPA "to make grants to, or         
  enter into cooperative agreements with private, nonprofit organizations            
  designated by the Secretary of Labor under Title V of the Older Americans Act      
  of 1965." These cooperative agreements are to utilize the talents of older         
  Americans in temporary, full time or part time positions "providing technical      
  assistance to Federal, State, and local environmental agencies for projects of     
  pollution prevention, abatement, and control." "Technical assistance" may          
  include any activity performed for the State in support of its projects ranging    
  from inspections of large capacity cesspools, to support for a State               
  Environmental staff office. This allows for coverage of all types of SEE program   
  positions from professional to clerical. Annual funding priorities are established 
  by EPA program officials and the participating state program office requiring      
  SEE Program support.

  control. An agency eligible for assistance for two or more pollution control
  programs may consolidate its assistance requests into a single application and
  receive a single consolidated award in an effort to reduce administrative and
  application costs. The consolidated grants program does not represent funding in
  addition to grants provided under individual authorities, but merely represents
  the amount of consolidation taking place within the Agency's total grant
  appropriations. Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2008: To provide technical and
