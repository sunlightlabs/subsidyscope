  share of project costs may be provided by cash or by in- kind contributions and     
  other non-cash support.                                                             
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                                
  The majority of the grants are completed in a one-year project period which is      
  the preferred length of time. However, some flexibility up to two year project      
  periods is possible depending upon the nature and complexity of the project.        
  Activities must be completed within the time frame of the budget period.            
  Concurrent grants to the same organization during the second year are not           
  allowed. Grants may be incrementally or fully funded. This determination is         
  made by the EPA.                                                                    
Reports:                                                                              
  Recipients of grants are expected to submit progress reports on at least a semi-    
  annual basis. Final reports and two copies of all grants products are due within

  90 days of the close of the budget period.

                                                                                      
Audits:

  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the      
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,      
  other EPA staff, or any authorized representative of the Federal government.

  Reviews by the EPA Project Officer and the Grants Specialist may occur each         
  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,         
  June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit                
  Organizations," non-federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in      
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that   
  year. Non-federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal         
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted    
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.                                                          
Records:                                                                              
  Financial records, including all documents to support entries on accounting         
  records and to substantiate changes to each assistance agreement, must be kept      
  available to personnel authorized to examine EPA assistance accounts. All           
  records must be maintained until the expiration of three years from the date of     
  submission of the final expenditure report. If questions still remain, such as      
  those raised as the result of an audit, related records should be retained until the
  matter is completely resolved.                                                      
Account Identification:

Obligations:                                                                          
  FY 07 $1,340,000; FY 08 $3,400,000; and FY 09 est. $3,300,000 (subject to           
  Congressional appropriation)                                                        
Range and Average of Financial Assistance:                                            
  Range $7,000 to $125,000 per grant. Average financial assistance: Regional          
  grants $12,000 to $15,000 per grant and Headquarters $90,000 per grant.             
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:                                                              
  Each year, Headquarters awards approximately 10 grants and the ten EPA              
  Regional Offices award 10 to 15 each for a total of about 135 grants nationwide.    
  In a typical annual grant cycle, these Environmental Education Grants educate       
  approximately 6,000 teachers, 20,000 students, and 12,000 members of the            
  general public. In Fiscal Year 2006, EPA Headquarters awarded 10 grants from        
  a pool of 105 grant applications; and the ten EPA Regional Offices awarded          
  almost 135 grants from a pool of over 850 grant applications. In 2007 less          
  funding was available and less than half that number of grants were awarded. In     
  2008, the issuance of grants repeated the typical grant pattern as stated above for 
  2006. For the 2009 grant cycle, assuming Congress makes an appropriation for        
  this program, it is anticipated that the ratio of applications to awards will follow
  past patterns and approximately 10 percent of the headquarters applications and     
  30 percent of the regional office proposals will be funded. This grant program is   
  expected to reach a target audience of about 6,000 teachers, 20,000 students and    
  12,000 members of the public in the next fiscal year.
