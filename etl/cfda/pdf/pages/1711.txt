  originally stated aims; a list of the significant results; and a list of publications 
  resulting from the projects. For most projects a financial status report is required  
  90 days after each competitive segment. Cooperative agreements and

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  (1) Retinal Diseases: Projects include studies of the development, molecular and
  cell biology, molecular genetics, and metabolism of the photoreceptor cells and
  the underlying retinal pigment epithelium; the mechanism of the retina's
  response to light and the initial processing of information that is transmitted to
  the visual centers of the brain; the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy; the
  fundamental causes of and etiologic factors responsible for uveitis; the
  molecular genetic mechanisms underlying retinoblastoma and ocular melanoma;
  the genetics of retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, and
  related disorders; and the cellular and molecular events that accompany retinal
  detachment. (2) Corneal Diseases: Projects include studies of the regulation of
  genes that express proteins unique to corneal tissue; the details of the
  macromolecular and supramolecular assembly of extracellular corneal matrices;
  the characterization of cytokines and cell surface receptors which interact with
  corneal cells, pathogens, and blood borne cells; the pathogenesis of corneal
  infections; the mechanisms that maintain corneal hydration and transparency;
  the physiologic basis for immune privilege in the cornea; corneal development,
  growth, and wound healing; the biomechanics of the cornea; the characterization
  of genes responsible for corneal dystrophy; and, the correction of refractive
  errors. (3) Lens and Cataract: Projects include studies of lens development,
  characterization of changes in lens physiology and biochemistry related to aging
  and cataract formation, the identification of those molecular components and
  physiological processes required to maintain transparency, studies to identify
  what controls lens shape and its accommodative dynamics, the molecular and
  cellular characterization of the control of lens cell division and differentiation;
  genetic studies to map and identify cataract genes, studies to describe the
  structure and function of lens crystallins, and studies to identify those insults
  that lead to cataract formation such as oxidative stress. (4) Glaucoma and Optic
  Neuropathies: Projects include studies of the genetics of glaucoma, the cellular
  and molecular nature of the extracellular matrix proteins of the trabecular
  meshwork; the basic mechanisms that control aqueous humor dynamics; the
  design of better pharmacologic agents to modulate aqueous humor secretion and
  outflow, and characterization of mechanisms of optic nerve damage and the cell
  biology of retinal ganglion cell death. (5) Strabismus, Amblyopia, and Visual
  Processing: Projects include studies of the function of the neural pathways from
  the eye to the brain, the central processing of visual information, visual
  perception, optical properties of the eye, functioning of the pupil, and control of
  the ocular muscles; congenital, developmental, and degenerative abnormalities
  of the visual sensorimotor system, particularly strabismus and amblyopia.
  Additional emphasis is placed on and support provided for research on optic
  neuropathies, eye movement disorders, and the development of myopia. (6) Low
  Vision and Blindness Rehabilitation: Projects include studies aimed at
  improving the methods of specifying, measuring and categorizing loss of visual
  function; devising strategies to help visually impaired people maximize the use
  of their residual vision; systematically evaluating new and existing visual aids;
  developing an adequate epidemiological base for blindness, partial loss of sight
  and visual anomalies; and studying the optical, electronic, and other
  rehabilitative needs of people with visual impairments. (7) Collaborative
  Clinical Research: Projects include a number of clinical trials and other
  epidemiologic research projects including single-center randomized clinical
  trials, multicenter randomized clinical trials, natural history studies, risk factor
  analyses using case-control and prospective cohortmethods,and
  health services research. These projects have the goal of improving the
  understanding, the prevention, and the management of visual system diseases
  and disorders including, for example, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular
  degeneration, corneal diseases, cataract, glaucoma, and optic nerve atrophy, the
  leading causes of blindness in the United States.
