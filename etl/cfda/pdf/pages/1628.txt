  Discretionary Funds are awarded to States via a block grant, which, through          
  their appointed Lead Agencies, make many of the decisions about priorities,          
  policies, and expenditures in achieving goals related to improved family access      
  to quality child care. States are required to commit at least four percent of their  
  Discretionary Funds to activities such as consumer education, resource and           
  referral services, provider training, and caregiver recruitment designed to          
  improve child care availability and quality. Targeted funds designated for           
  quality, infant and toddler care, resource and referral, and school-age care,        
  further support State efforts to improve child care access and quality.
