EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:                                                        
  The program supports foreign language instruction in elementary schools,          
  immersion programs, curriculum development, professional development, and         
  distance learning. One school district is designing a new plan for dual language  
  immersion that will improve the program and serve as a model for other districts. 
   The new plan will outline how administrators, teachers, university researchers,  
  students, and parents can collaborate to increase student academic success and    
  English and Spanish language proficiency while developing an appreciation for     
  multiculturalism. The new plan will address all significant gaps and needs in the 
  current immersion program, offering improvements that are based on state and      
  national standards, research on language acquisition, best practices of           
  instruction, and rigorous evaluation.                                             
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:

  project design. The FY 08 competition includes an absolute priority for projects

  that exclusively teach one or more critical lanaguages. Critical languages are    
  defined as languages critical to United States national security and include      
  Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Russian, and languages in the Indic, Iranian,  
  and Turkic language families.
