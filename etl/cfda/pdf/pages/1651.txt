  The purpose of Part A of the RHY Act (Runaway and Homeless Youth Grant              
  Program) is to establish or strengthen locally controlled community-based           
  programs that address the immediate needs of runaway and homeless youth and         
  their families. Services must be delivered outside of the law enforcement, child    
  welfare, mental health and juvenile justice systems. The goals and objectives of    
  the Basic Center Program are to: 1) Alleviate problems of runaway and homeless      
  youth; 2) reunite youth with their families and encourage the resolution of         
  intrafamily problems through counseling and other services; 3) strengthen family    
  relationships and encourage stable living conditions for youth; and 4) help youth   
  decide upon constructive courses of action.                                         
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                  
  Project Grants.

  Each Basic Center program is required to provide outreach to runaway and            
  homeless youth; temporary shelter for up to fifteen (15) days; food; clothing;      
  individual, group and family counseling; aftercare and referrals, as appropriate.   
  Basic Center programs are required to provide their services in residential         
  settings for at no more than twenty (20) youth unless a state or local law or       
  regulation requires a higher maximum to comply with licensure requirments for       
  facilities serving child and youth. Some programs also provide part or all of       
  their shelter services through host homes (usually private homes under contract     
  to the centers), with counseling and referrals being provided from a central        
  location. Basic Center programs offer shelter to youth who are less than 18         
  years of age and who are at risk of separation from their family.                   
Applicant Eligibility:
