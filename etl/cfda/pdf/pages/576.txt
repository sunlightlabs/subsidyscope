  Real Estate Services funds land sales, leasing, preparation of probate documents    
  and estate planning. Real Estate Appraisals are conducted for commercial,           
  residential, and industrial properties, including leased agricultural trust lands.  
  Lease Compliance funds reviews of lease documents, investigations of lease          
  violations and trespass issues, and physical inspections of leased property

CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:                                                     
  Funding levels for Real Estate Services and Real Estate Appraisals are              
  determined by the individual Tribe through participation in the BIA's budget        
  formulation process. All applicants meeting the criteria in 25 CFR Part 900 will    
  be funded. Appraisals are conducted for all transactions involving trust property.  
  The time required to complete an appraisal depends on the number of requests        
  being processed by a specific office and the resources available to meet the        
  requests. Lease Compliance funds are distributed to the area offices based on       
  three factors: (1) total number of leases, (2) total number of acres, and (3) total 
  amount of income derived from leases. Awards for lease compliance are               
  determined by the number of qualifying leases reported to the Agency and Area       


                                                                                 11-08
  Offices. Minimum funding of $50,000 is allocated to each area office. In
  allocating program resources, priority is given to activities involving agriculture,
  oil and gas, mining, industrial, business, recreational, and other income-
