  Formula: Payments to States for fiscal year 1955 was a fixed base and sums

  appropriated in excess of 1955 level use the following fund allocation statistical    
  factors: (1) 20 percent allotted equally to each State; (2) not less than 52 percent

  to States as follows: One-half in an amount which bears the same ratio as the         
  rural population of the State bears to the total rural population of all the States   
  (and the source is the 1990 Decennial Census); and one-half in an amount which        
  bears the same ratio as the farm population of the State bears to the total farm      
  population of all the States (and the source is the 1990 Decennial Census); and       
  (3) at least 25 percent to States for cooperative research in which 2 or more State   
  agricultural experiment stations are cooperating to solve problems of agriculture     
  in more than one State. The statistical factor used for eligibility does not apply to 
  this program. Matching requirement: Federal funds must be matched with                
  nonfederal funding on a dollar-for-dollar basis. In the case of Guam, the Virgin

  system that uses infrared video to assess spray coverage of crop protection
  products on the complex surface of a vertical grain head; (2) Researchers
  conducted a scientific review of available information and concluded that
  dietary fat recommendations for adults have been inappropriately applied to
  children. The researchers suggested that dietary fat should not be restricted until
  5 years of age and reduced gradually down to 30 percent throughout childhood
  and teen years.
