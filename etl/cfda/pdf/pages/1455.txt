  In fiscal year 2007, 573 research project grant (RPG) awards were made, of          
  which 176 were competitive RPG applications. 4 STTR and 34 SBIR awards              
  were also made, of which 27 were competing. In addition, 36 Center grant            
  awards were made in fiscal year 2007 including: 2 MFB Center Grant                  
  awards(P30); 21 EHS Center grant awards (P30); 9 Specialized Centers (P50); 4       
  Specialized Center Cooperative Grants (U54). Nine competing Center P30 grant        
  applications were considered and four were funded. Also in fiscal year 2007, 53     
  Individual and 57 Institutional NRSA's were made. 48 competing Individual           
  NRSA applications were considered and 22 funded, while 13 competing                 
  Institutional NRSA T32 applications were considered and 8 were funded. During       
  fiscal year 2008, 555 RPG awards are expected to be made (including SBIR and        
  STTR awards), while 29 Center grants, 53 Individual and 53 Institutional NRSA       
  awards are expected to be funded. In fiscal year 2009, it is anticipated that 540   
  RPG awards (including SBIR and STTR awards), 29 Center grants, 48                   
  Individual and 53 Institutional NRSAs will be made. During FY 2007/08,              
  NIEHS awarded two DISCOVER Centers which focus on the role of                       
  environmental exposures in the development of asthma. They include                  
  mechanistic, clinical and public health related research designed to advance our

                                                                                      
  understanding of this prevalent respiratory disease in children. NIEHS is one of    
1268                                                                            11-08

  the lead agencies at NIH involved in the Genes Environment and Health
  Initiative responsible for the Exposure Biology Program. The development of
  biomarkers, biosensors and to improve our understanding of exposure
  assessment of environmental agents. Within the field of the health effects of
  endocrine disrupting chemicals, NIESH supported research looking at exposures
  to these agents during development and early life and their health effects during
  childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Organochlorine pesticides were shown to
  affect birth outcomes such as birth weight and head circumference and motor
  development. A pilot project in our Breast Cancer research centers, phthlates
  and other EDCs were found in detectible levels in urine of girls ages 6-8 and
  researchers are studying whether these levels effect the timing of puberty.
  Animal experiments also link these types of chemicals, especially Bis-Phenol-A
  to prostate and breast cancer susceptibility. Researchers supported by NIEHS are
  also involved in research on the cardiopulmonary effects of air pollution.
  NIEHS researchers have reported on the relationship between pesticides and
  Parkinson's Disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Scientists are also
  engaged in basic research in the areas of oxidative stress, DNA repair and
  cellular signaling in response to exposures to a wide variety of toxicants. The
  National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Human
  Genome Research Institute jointly launched a new Ruth L Kirschstein National
  Research Service Award Institutional Training Program in Human Genes and the
  Environment. The new Genes and Environment Training Program seeks to build
  upon the established foundations in exposure biology an high throughput
  genomics to produce a new generation of scientists who are equally at home in
  genomics and environmental health sciences and can seamlessly interact with
  both groups of scientists. These results point out the usefulness of applying
  proteomics technology as a tool for the discovery of early biomarkers of
  exposure to environmental chemicals. Theoretically, similar analyses could be
  used to identify susceptible individuals or could be used as a diagnostic tool for
  discovering the cause of disease. The study also sheds light on the possible
  mechanisms of the immunosuppressive effects of benzene.
