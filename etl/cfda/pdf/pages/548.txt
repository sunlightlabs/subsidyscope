OBJECTIVES:                                                                         
  To aid very low income families in obtaining decent, safe, and sanitary rental    
  housing. For Welfare-to-Work rental vouchers, families must also meet special     
  welfare-to-work criteria. HUD regulations merged the former Section 8 Rental      
  Voucher program (14.855) with the former Section 8 Certificate program            
  (14.857). Section 502 of the Public Housing Reform Act states that a purpose of   
  the legislation is "consolidating the voucher and certificate programs for rental 
  assistance under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the          
  "USHA") into a single market-driven program that will assist in making tenant-    
  based rental assistance more successful at helping low-income families obtain     
  affordable housing and will increase housing choice for low-income families."     
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                
  Direct Payments for Specified Use.                                                
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                          
  Provides housing assistance payments to participating owners on behalf of         
  eligible tenants to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing for very low       
  income families at rents they can afford. Housing assistance payments are         
  generally the difference between the local payment standard and 30 percent of     
  the family's adjusted income.                                                     
Applicant Eligibility:                                                              
  Applicants are limited to public housing agencies. A public housing agency        
  (PHA) is defined as any State, county, municipality or other governmental entity  
  or public body (or agency or instrumentality thereof) which is authorized to      
  engage in or assist in the development or operation of housing for very low       
  income families; and, a consortium of PHAs; any other nonprofit entity that was   
  administering a Section 8 tenant-based program on October 21, 1998; or, for an    
  area outside the jurisdiction of a PHA administering a voucher program, a         
  private nonprofit entity or a governmental entity or public body that would       
  otherwise lack jurisdiction to administer the program in such area.               
Beneficiary Eligibility:                                                            
  Very low income families (whose income does not exceed 50 percent of the          
  median income for the area as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for    
  smaller and larger families) and, on an exception basis, lower income families    
  (whose income does not exceed 80 percent of the median income for the area,       
                                                                                    
                                                                               11-08
  adjusted for smaller and larger families). At least 75 percent of families
  admitted to the voucher program during the PHA fiscal year must be extremely
  low income families (whose income does not exceed 30 percent of the median
  income for the area).
Credentials/Documentation:
  In the Housing Choice Voucher Program, the PHA must support its application
  by furnishing data that the program proposed is responsive to the condition of
  the housing stock in the community and the housing assistance needs of very
  low income families (including the elderly, handicapped and disabled, large
  families and those displaced) residing in the community. This program is
  excluded from coverage under OMB Circular No. A-87.
Preapplication Coordination:
  The Department will publish a Notice of Funding availability (NOFA) in the
  Federal Register identifying allocation areas, amount of funds available for each
  area, and the selection criteria for rating and ranking applications. Applicants
  will have at least 30 days to submit an application. This program is excluded
  from coverage under OMB Circular No. A-102 and E.O. 12372.

  for more or less than the payment standard. When initially leasing a unit where
  the gross rent exceeds the payment standard, a family may not pay more than 40
  percent of adjusted monthly income.
