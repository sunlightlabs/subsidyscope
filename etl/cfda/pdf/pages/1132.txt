Renewals:                                                                            
  Renewals are subject to approval of the individual estuary management              
  organization. Contact the appropriate EPA Regional office for guidance.            
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                   
  This program has no statutory formula. Public Law 106-457, which amended           
  Section 320(g) of the Water Quality Act of 1987, limits the amount of grants to    
  75 percent of the aggregate CCMP development project costs for each estuary        
  program and to 50 percent of the aggregate CCMP implementation project costs       
  for each estuary program, and requires that the nonfederal share be provided       
  from nonfederal sources. The nonfederal share can be contributed by any of the     
  participants in the management conference. Contact the appropriate                 
  management conference program office or EPA Regional Office for more               
  information.                                                                       
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                               
  Assistance agreements are typically funded on a 12-month basis (yearly). Project   
  period may cover up to 36 months, with continuations possible for certain types    
  of projects. Payments will be on a letter of credit or advance basis.              
Reports:                                                                             
  Quarterly interim and final progress and expenditure reports; program              
  evaluations; and other reports as required by the specific terms of the            
  Agreement. Financial Status Reports must be submitted for each project at the      
  end of each fiscal year.                                                           
Audits:                                                                              
  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the     
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,     
  other EPA staff, or any authorized representative of the Federal government.       
  Reviews by the EPA Project Officer and the Grants Specialist may occur each        
  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,        
  June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit               
  Organizations," non-federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in     
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that  
  year. Non-federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal        
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted   
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.                                                         
Records:                                                                             
  Financial records, including all documents to support entries on accounting

  records and to substantiate changes to each grant, must be kept available to

  personnel authorized to examine EPA grant accounts. All records must be

                                                                                     
  maintained until expiration of 3 years from the date of submission of the final    
  expenditure report. If questions still remain, such as those raised as a result of 
  audit, related records should be retained until the matter is completely resolved.

  For FY 07, each of the 28 NEPs received base funding in the amount of              
  $418,000; For FY08, each of the NEPs received base funding in the amount of        
  $591,750.                                                                          
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:                                                             
  Maintaining high-quality habitat is one way of ensuring the health of the nation's 
  estuaries. Since 2000, the NEPs and their partners have protected and restored     
  over 1,100,000 acres of habitat within the 28 NEP estuarine watersheds. The        
  acreage protected and restored by the NEPs and their partners enhances the 28      
  NEP estuaries' capacity to support healthy populations of wildlife and marine      
  organisms, including many commercially-valuable fisheries. That acreage also       
  enhances the 28 estuarine watersheds' capacity to support the economic,            
  environmental, and aesthetic functions on which coastal populations depend for     
  their livelihood. In FY 07, the NEPs and their partners protected and restored     
  over 102,000 acres of estuarine habitat within their estuarine watersheds. In FY   
  08, grants will continue to support CCMP implementation, providing support for     
  NEP efforts targeting priority problems like nutrient over-enrichment;             
  stormwater,climate change and aquatic invasive species impacts; habitat

66.458 CAPITALIZATION GRANTS FOR CLEAN WATER
STATE REVOLVING FUNDS
   (CW State Revolving Fund)
FEDERAL AGENCY:
  OFFICE OF WATER, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
AUTHORIZATION:
  Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended, Public Law 95-217; Water Quality Act of
  1987, Sections 601 through 607, 205(m), Public Law 100-4.
OBJECTIVES:
  To create State Revolving Funds (SRFs) through a program of capitalization
  grants to States which will provide a long term source of State financing for
  construction of wastewater treatment facilities and implementation of other
  water quality management activities (see CFDA 66.418). Funding Priority -
  Fiscal Year 2008: Capitalization grants are available to each State for the
  purpose of establishing a Clean Water SRF for providing assistance for: (1)
  construction of publicly owned wastewater treatment works; (2) implementing
  nonpoint source management activities included in State Plans developed
  pursuant to Section 319; and (3) developing and implementing an estuary
  comprehensive conservation and management plan under Section 320. The
  capitalization grant is deposited in the State's SRF, which is used to provide
  loans and other types of financial assistance, but not grants, to local
  communities and intermunicipal and interstate agencies. Up to 4 percent of the
  grant amounts may be used by the States for the cost of administering the SRF.
  States determine priorities for funding within their State in accordance with the
  CWA. The program supports the Agency's strategic goal of ensuring Clean and
                                                                                  945
