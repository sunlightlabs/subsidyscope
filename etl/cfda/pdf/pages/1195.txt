Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:                                                     
  About 120 to 150 days.                                                                
Appeals:                                                                                
  Assistance agreement competition-related disputes will be resolved in                 
  accordance with the dispute resolution procedures published in 70 FR (Federal         
  Register) 3629, 3630 (January 26, 2005). Copies of these procedures may also          
  be requested by contacting the individual(s) listed as "Information Contacts."        
  Disputes relating to matters other than the competitive selection of recipients       
  will be resolved under 40 CFR 30.63 or 40 CFR 31.70, as applicable.                   
Renewals:                                                                               
  None.                                                                                 
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                      
  The statutory formula for P2 and PPIN grants is authorized by the Pollution           
  Prevention Act of 1990. Organizations receiving grant funds through the P2 and        
  PPIN Grant Programs are required to match Federal funds by at least 50 percent.       
  For example, the Federal government will provide half of the total allowable cost     
  of the project, and the State will provide the other half. A grant request for        
  $100,000 would support a total allowable project cost of $200,000, with the           
  State providing $100,000. State contributions may include: dollars, in kind           
  goods and services, and/or third party contributions. With concern to P2 Grants       
  only: If a Tribe or Intertribal Consortium is selected for an award, and the Tribe    
  includes the funds from a performance partnership grant (PPG) awarded under           
  40 CFR Part 35, Subpart B, the required Tribal match for the Pollution                
  Prevention portion of the PPG will be reduced to 5% of the allowable Pollution        
  Prevention project cost for the first two years of the PPG grant. After the first     
  two years in which a Tribe or Intertribal Consortium receives a Performance           
  Partnership Grant, the Regional Administrator must determine through objective        
  assessment whether the Tribe or the members of an Intertribal Consortium meet         
  socioeconomic indicators that demonstrate the ability of the Tribe or the             
  Intertribal Consortium to provide a cost share greater than five percent.             
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                                  
  Assistance agreements are awarded for a project period not to exceed 3 years.         
  Funds are released by a letter of credit.                                             
Reports:                                                                                
  Organizations that are awarded grants will be required to submit quarterly or         
  semi annual progress reports, during the life of the project, to the EPA Project      
  Officer. Each report will summarize funds expended, tasks accomplished, and           
  results achieved to date. A summary final report will also be required at the end     
  of the project period. This final report should include a discussion of the           
  prospects for continuation, further development of the pollution prevention           
  effort, project evaluation and future direction.                                      
Audits:                                                                                 
  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the        
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,        
  other EPA staff, or any authorized representative of the Federal government.          
  Reviews by the EPA Project Officer and the Grants Specialist may occur each           
  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,           
  June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit                  
  Organizations," non-federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in        
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that     
  year. Non-federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal           
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted      
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.                                                            
Records:                                                                                
  Financial records, including all documents to support entries on accounting           
  records to substantiate charges to each grant, must be kept available to personnel    
  authorized to examine EPA grant accounts. All records must be maintained for          
  three years from the date of submission of the annual financial status report. If     
  questions still remain, such as those raised as a result of an audit, related records 
  should be retained until the matter is completely resolved.                           
Account Identification:

Obligations:

Range and Average of Financial Assistance:

PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:                                                                
  In FY '07, EPA awarded 46 P2 Grants totaling $3,954,541. P2 Grants were               
  issued to State institutions to develop projects to provide pollution prevention      
  technical assistance. In FY '07, EPA awarded 8 PPIN Grants totaling $819,434.         
  PPIN Grants were issued to State institutions to strengthen the efficiency and        
  effectiveness of retrieving electronic pollution prevention information and/or        
  resources nationwide. In FY '08, EPA plans to award between 40 - 50 P2 Grants         
  totaling $4,043,000. P2 Grants are made available to State institutions and           
  Federally-recognized tribes to develop projects to provide pollution prevention       
  technical assistance. In FY '08, EPA plans to award 7 PPIN Grants totaling            
  $820,000. PPIN Grants will be issued to State institutions to strengthen the          
  efficiency and effectiveness of retrieving electronic pollution prevention

  information and/or resources nationwide. EPA anticipates similar
