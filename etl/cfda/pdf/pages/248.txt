OBJECTIVES:                                                                          
  To assist very low, low-income, and moderate-income households to obtain           
  modest, decent, safe, and sanitary housing for use as a permanent residence in     
  rural areas.                                                                       
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                 
  Direct Loans; Guaranteed/Insured Loans.                                            
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                           
  Direct and guaranteed loans may be used to buy, build, or improve the              
  applicant's permanent residence. New manufactured homes may be financed            
  when they are on a permanent site, purchased from an approved dealer or            
  contractor, and meet certain other requirements. Under very limited                
  circumstances, homes may be re-financed with direct loans. Dwellings financed      
  must be modest, decent, safe, and sanitary. The value of a home financed with a    
  direct loan may not exceed the area limit. The property must be located in an      
  eligible rural area. Assistance is available in the States, the Commonwealth of    
  Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the                    
  Commonwealth of Northern Mariana's, and the Trust Territories of the Pacific       
  Islands. Direct loans are made at the interest rate specified in RD Instruction    
  440.1, Exhibit B (available in any Rural Development local office), and are        
  repaid over 33 years or 38 years for applicants whose adjusted annual income       
  does not exceed 60 percent of the area median income, if necessary to show         
  repayment ability. Payment assistance is granted on direct loans to reduce the     
  installment to an "effective interest rate" as low as one percent, depending on    
  adjusted family income. Payment assistance is subject to recapture by the          
  government when the customer no longer resides in the dwelling. There is no        
  funding provided for deferred mortgage authority or loans for deferred mortgage    
  assumptions. Guaranteed loans may be made to refinance either existing RD          
  Guaranteed Housing loans or RHS Section 502 Direct Housing loans.                  
  Guaranteed loans are amortized over 30 years. The interest rate is negotiated      
  with the lender.                                                                   
Applicant Eligibility:                                                               
  Applicants must have very low-, low- or moderate incomes. Very low-income is       
  defined as below 50 percent of the area median income (AMI); low-income is         
  between 50 and 80 percent of AMI; moderate income is below 115 percent of          
  AMI. Families must be without adequate housing, but able to afford the housing     
  payments, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI). Qualifying   
  repayment ratios are 29 percent for PITI to 41 percent for total debt. In addition,
  applicants must be unable to obtain credit elsewhere, yet have an acceptable       
  credit history.                                                                    
Beneficiary Eligibility:
