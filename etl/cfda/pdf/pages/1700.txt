  termination of National Research Service Awards to ascertain compliance with      
  the service and payback provisions. A Financial Status Report must be             
  submitted within 90 days after the close of each budget period for which an       
  award has been issued.

  27, 2003), "Audits of States and Local Governments," and Nonprofit                
  Organizations," nonfederal entities that expend financial assistance of $500,000  
  or more in Federal awards will have a single or a program-specific audit          
  conducted for that year. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $500,000 or    
  more in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that        
  year, except as noted in Circular No. A-133. In addition, grants and cooperative

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:

  Grants support research on neurological disorders such as: (1) Cerebral palsy;    
  (2) disorders of aging including Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's       
  diseases and the dementias; (3) muscular, neuromuscular and demyelinating         
  disorders; (4) neuroendocrine studies; neural aspect of learning and behavior; (5)
  nervous system tumors, and infectious diseases of the central nervous system.     
  Recently funded applications include studies designed to result in advances for a 
  group of useful glycosidases, as well as mechanistic information for the activator
  protein that is required for lysosomal degradation of GM2, a glycosphingolipid    
  involved in Tay-Sachs disease. Another study focuses on mechanisms of             


                                                                               11-08
  synapse assembly, specifically the role of membrane associated quanylate
  kinases in the clustering and targeting of ion channels and receptors at the
  synapse. One example of the long range goal of a successful competing renewal
  application is to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of movement
  of intracellular organelles along microtubules. Such movement plays a role in
  the process of fast axonal transport in nerve cells. The specific aims of another
  funded application are to assess environmental and genetic factors as
  determinants of hand preference, to determine whether measures of
  developmental stability can explain individual differences in phenotypic
  expressions of hand preference and to determine whether handiness is predictive
  of compromised immunological functioning and/or reproductive biology. A
  new project is aimed at addressing a series of fundamental issues regarding the
  mechanisms underlying the spread of synaptic modifications in neural networks.
  Another series of studies will take advantage of newly developed behavioral
  procedures and selective ibotenic acid lesions to compare the effects of lesioning
  hippocampus, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex on learning
  and memory. Included in this effort are multi-disciplinary clinical research
  centers on Parkinson's disease, stroke, head and spinal cord injury, epilepsy, and
  demyelinating disorders, as well as program projects and a large number of
  individual grants. In head and spinal cord injury research studies, particular
  emphasis is given to the biomedical events and metabolism following injuries,
  with a view toward both salvaging damaged tissue and also creating conditions
  in which regeneration of injured nerve cells can take place. The clinical research
  program sponsors clinical trials to evaluate various therapeutic approaches to
  head and spinal cord injury, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and other neurologic
  and neuromuscular disorders. The effects of systemic cancer on the central
  nervous system are studied, as part of the brain and spinal cord tumor research
  effort.

OBJECTIVES:
  To assist public and private nonprofit institutions and individuals to establish,
  expand, and improve biomedical research and research training in allergic and
  immunologic diseases and related areas to assist public, private, and commercial
  institutions to conduct developmental research; to produce and test research
  materials; and to provide research services as required by the agency for research
  progress in allergic and immunologic diseases. NIAID's Allergy, Immunology
  and Transplantation Research concerns the immune system as it functions in the
  maintenance of health and as it malfunctions in the production of diseases.
  Because of this dual focus, the program encompasses both basic research and
  clinical research. Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program expands
