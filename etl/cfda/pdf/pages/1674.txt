OBJECTIVES:                                                                         
  To provide financial assistance to States for payments of medical assistance on   
  behalf of cash assistance recipients, children, pregnant women, and the aged      
  who meet income and resource requirements, and other categorically-eligible       
  groups. In certain States that elect to provide such coverage, medically-needy    
  persons, who, except for income and resources, would be eligible for cash         
  assistance, may be eligible for medical assistance payments under this program.   
  Financial assistance is provided to States to pay for Medicare premiums,          
  copayments and deductibles of qualified Medicare beneficiaries meeting certain    
  income requirements. More limited financial assistance is available for certain   
  Medicare beneficiaries with higher incomes.                                       
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:

USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  For the categorically needy, States must provide in-and-out patient hospital
  services; rural health clinic services; federally-qualified health center services;
  other laboratory and x-ray services; nursing facility services, home health
  services for persons over age 21; family planning services; physicians' services;
  early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment for individuals under age
  21; pediatric or family nurse practitioner services; and services furnished by a
  nurse-midwife as licensed by the States. For the medically needy, States are
  required to provide a minimum mix of services for which Federal financial
  participation is available (see section 1902(a)(10)(C)(iv) of the Social Security
  Act).
Applicant Eligibility:
  State and local welfare agencies must operate under an HHS-approved Medicaid
  State Plan and comply with all Federal regulations governing aid and medical
  assistance to the needy.
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  Low-income persons who are over age 65, blind or disabled, members of
  families with dependent children, low- income children and pregnant women,
  certain Medicare beneficiaries and, in many States, medically-needy individuals
  may apply to a State or local welfare agency for medical assistance. Eligibility is
  determined by the State in accordance with Federal regulations.
Credentials/Documentation:
  Federal funds must go to a designated State Medicaid Agency. Individuals must
  meet State requirements. Administrative costs will be determined in accordance
  with OMB Circular No. A-87, "Cost Principles for State and Local
  Governments."
Preapplication Coordination:
  The standard application forms, as furnished by HHS and required by OMB
  Circular No. A-102, "Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants-in-Aid
  to State and Local Governments," must be used for this program. States should
  contact the HHS Regional Office for application information. (See Appendix IV
  of the Catalog for agency Regional Office addresses.) This program is excluded
  from coverage under E.O. 12372.
Application Procedure:
  Individuals needing medical assistance should apply directly to the State or local
  welfare agency. States should contact the Regional Administrator, CMS for
  application forms. (See Appendix IV of the Catalog for agency Regional Office
  addresses.) This program is excluded from coverage under OMB Circular No. A-
  110.
Award Procedure:
  States are awarded funds quarterly based on their estimates of funds needed to
  provide medical assistance to the needy. Awards are made quarterly on a fiscal
  year basis as follows: October 1, January 1, April 1, and July 1. Individuals
  receive medical care from providers of medical care who are participating in the
  Medicaid program.
Deadlines:
  An individual needing medical assistance may apply to the State at any time.
  States must submit quarterly estimates of funds needed no later than August 15,
  November 15, February 15, and May 15, in order to receive a timely quarterly
  grant award for the following quarter.
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:
  Up to 60 days. The States usually provide needy individuals with immediate
  medical assistance.
Appeals:
  Individuals denied medical assistance by the State or local welfare agency must
  be given a fair hearing on appeal (see 42 CFR, Subchapter C, Part 431, Subpart
  E). States have 60 days to resubmit revised applications.
Renewals:
  Recipients receive assistance as long as they are qualified under State
  requirements.
Formula and Matching Requirements:
  Federal funds are available to match State expenditures for medical care. Under
  the Act, the Federal share for medical services may range from 50 percent to 83
  percent. The statistical factors used for fund allocation are: (1) Medical
  assistance expenditures by State; and (2) per capita income by State based on a
  3-year average (source, "Personal Income," Department of Commerce, Bureau of
  Economic Analysis). Statistical factors for eligibility do not apply to this
  program. This program has maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements, see
  funding agency for further details.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  The needy receive medical assistance as necessary. States receive funds
  quarterly. The Electronic Transfer System will be used by States for monthly
  cash draws on the Federal Reserve Bank.
Reports:
  States must submit fiscal and statistical reports, as required, to the Centers for
  Medicare and Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services. A
  Treasury Report TUS-5401 is required monthly. States must submit certified
  expenditure reports within 30 days after the end of each quarter.
