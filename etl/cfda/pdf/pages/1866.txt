PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  USAID pursues multiple strategic objectives in more than 100 countries around
  the world. Individual country programs are tailored to local conditions. These
  objectives support the Agency's goals: (1) Broad-based Economic Growth and
  Agricultural Development Encouraged; (2) Democracy and Good Governance
  Strengthened; (3) Human Capacity Built through Education and Training; (4)
  World Population Stabilized and Human Health Protected; (5) The World's
  Environment Protected for Long-term Sustainability; (6) Lives Saved, Suffering
  Associated with Natural or Man-made Disasters Reduced, and Conditions for
  Political and/or Economic Development Re-established. Under its democracy
  goal USAID has accomplished significant results in promoting a politically
  active civil society. In Indonesia, the events of September 11 sparked an
  increased dialogue on democracy and the role of religion in Indonesia. USAID
  supported notable progress and a range of achievements by nearly 200 NGOs
  involved in transparent and participatory governance, conflict prevention and
  resolution, religious tolerance, human rights, media support and monitoring, and
  anticorruption activities. USAID expanded a program working with more than
  20 major religious and secular organizations, including Indonesia's two largest
  Muslim organizations with a combined membership of 50 million, to help shape
  a more open and informed debate. In Guinea, efforts to open political processes
  and emphasize dialogue are assisting national actors to bridge the gap between
  government and the governed and are helping to reduce social, ethnic, and
  political tensions that are potential sources of conflict. USAID/Guinea's key
  achievement was the sponsorship of a high-level conflict prevention activity in
  response to the destabilizing influence of the border war with Liberia and Sierra
  Leone. USAID's civil society program in Albania continues to reflect the
  country's need for considerable assistance to complete the transition to an open
  and free democratic republic. USAID's efforts focus on improving the electoral
  process, promoting political party development, enhancing parliamentary
  operations, strengthening Albanian civil society organizations, and supporting
  an independent media. USAID played a leading role within the donor
  community in supporting the successful parliamentary elections held in June
  2001, which were considered relatively open, fair, and free of abuse. These
  efforts strengthened NGOs, and the number of NGOs influencing policy
  formation and implementation has continued to increase. During the
  parliamentary elections, more than 25 local NGOs participated in elections
  monitoring throughout the country. USAID's accomplishments under its human
  capacity development goal are illustrated by girls education. In Ethiopia, USAID
  efforts at the community level to help girls stay in and succeed at school have
  raised girls participation in the two USAID focus regions to 73.9% and 48.1%,
  respectively, in the 2000-2001 school year, up from 38% and 17%, respectively,
  in the baseline 1994-1995 school year. Both these levels exceed the national
  average of 47%. Likewise in Guinea, the primary school gross enrollment rate
  (GER) reached 61.0% (up from 31.9% in 1991), while girls GER grew from
  19.7% to 50.0% during the same period. In FY 2001 alone, the GER indicator
                                                                                  1679
