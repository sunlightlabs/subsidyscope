  During fiscal year 2007, 2,118 veterans received the intensive inpatient           
  rehabilitation program for severely disabled blind and visually impaired patients  
  nationally at the 10 Blind Rehabilitation Centers. Blind Rehabilitation Service    
  deployed the national BR v.5.0 database to enhance patient referral and            
  streamline clinical data management; additional functionality enhancements are     
  underway. Mechanisms for tracking OEF/OIF service personnel have been              
  developed and deployed. Sixty-eight OEF/OIF veterans and active duty               
  personnel have been provided intensive rehabilitation for severe disability in the 
  centers; some patients have received multiple episodes of care, resulting in a     
  total of 81 inpatient stays at the centers. Blind Rehabilitation Centers have      
  developed and deployed new assessments and interventions for visual                
  consequences of traumatic brain injury following a joint VHA/DoD conference        
  providing current practices and innovative research ongoing in this area.
