  Research Grant applications submitted for renewal are reviewed and selected for    
  funding on a competitive basis. NRSA awards may be made for 1 to 5 years. No       
  individual may receive more than 5 years of aggregate NRSA support beyond          
  the predoctoral level, and no individual may receive NRSA support for more         
  than 3 years of support beyond the postdoctoral level. Institutional awards may    
  be renewed.

Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                               
  Research Grant awards are usually made annually with no project periods to         
  exceed 5 years in length. NRSA Institutional awards may be made for up to 5        
  years, and Individual awards may be made for up to 5 years at the predoctoral      
  level, 3 years at postdoctoral level, and 2 years at senior level. Normally SBIR

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  (1) Studies to fully utilize multiple forms of information (MRI and EEG); (2)
  Construction and investigation of a scanning equalization digital radiography
  (SEDR) system to over come the problems with projection x-ray imaging; (3)
  Utilization of functional magnetic resonance imaging (IMRI) technique based on
  the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast to provide a robust and
  noninvasive tool for studying functional processing of neural network at
  physiological and pathological conditions; (4) Development of two
  complimentary intervention devices for treating stroke victims: mechanical clot
  extraction system and a neurovascular stent; (5) Development of molecular array
  biosensors using metallic nanoparticle clusters to capture in parallel a large
  number of molecular species from very small samples typical of most collection
  procedures; and (6) Production of nanoparticles containing agents that will have
  cell and tissue specificity, and demonstration of the effectiveness of these
  nanoparticles in attaining the intended specificity in tissue permeation and
  localization.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
  The major elements in evaluating proposals include assessments of: (1)
  Significance: Does this study address an important problem? If the aims of the
  application are achieved, how will scientific knowledge be advanced? What will
  be the effect of these studies on the concepts or methods that drive this field? (2)
  Approach: Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and analyses
  adequately developed, well-integrated, and appropriate to the aims of the
  project? Does the applicant acknowledge potential problem areas and consider
  alternative tactics? (3) Innovation: Does the project employ novel concepts,
  approaches or method? Are the aims original and innovative? Does the project
  challenge existing paradigms or develop new methodologies or technologies? (4)
  Investigator: Is the investigator appropriately trained and well suited to carry out
  this work? Is the work proposed appropriate to the experience level of the
  principal investigator and other researchers (if any)? (5) Environment: Does the
  scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the
  probability of success? Do the proposed experiments take advantage of unique
  features of the scientific environment or employ useful collaborative
  arrangements? Is there evidence of institutional support? (6) the appropriateness
  of the proposed budget and duration in relation to the proposed research; (7) the
  relevance and importance to announced program objectives; (8) the adequacy of
  plans to include both genders, minorities and their subgroups, and children as
  appropriate for the scientific goals of the research. Plans for the recruitment and
  retention of subjects will also be evaluated; (9) the adequacy of the proposed
  protection for humans or the environment, to the extent they may be adversely
  affected by the project proposed in the application; and (10) the adequacy of the
  proposed plan to share data, if appropriate. The following criteria will be used
  in considering the scientific and technical merit of SBIR/STTR Phase I grant
  applications: (1) The soundness and technical merit of the proposed approach;
  (2) the qualifications of the proposed principal investigator, supporting staff, and
  consultants; (3) the technological innovation of the proposed research; (4) the
  potential of the proposed research for commercial application; (5) the
  appropriateness of the budget requested; (6) the adequacy and suitability of the
  facilities and research environment; and (7) where applicable, the adequacy of
  assurances detailing the proposed means for (a) safeguarding human or animal
  subjects, and/or (b) protecting against or minimizing any adverse effect on the
  environment. Phase II grant applications will be reviewed based upon the
  following criteria: (1) The degree to which the Phase I objectives were met and
  feasibility demonstrated; (2) the scientific and technical merit of the proposed
  approach for achieving the Phase II objectives; (3) the qualifications of the
  proposed principal investigator, supporting staff, and consultants; (4) the
