  If additional support is desired to continue a research project beyond the          
  approved project period, an application for competing continuation must be          
  submitted for review in the same manner as a new application. Projects are          
  renewable for periods of 1 to 3 years.                                              
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                    
  There are no statutory formula or matching requirements for most programs.          
  There is a 1 to 4 match requirement for the tobacco control program, this           
  excludes quitline. Steps to a Healthier US: A Community-Focused Initiative to       
  Reduce the Burden of Asthma, Diabetes, and Obesity requires the following:          
  Matching funds are required from non-Federal sources in an amount not less          
  than 25 percent of Federal funds awarded to Large City and Urban Community          
  Grantees. State grantees funded under the State-Coordinated Small City and          
  Rural Community Program are required to provide a match not less than 50            
  percent of the funds retained by the states to support the funded communities       
  through technical assistance and other means. In no case shall the amount to be     
  matched be less than 25 percent of the award to the state. In an effort to move     
  grantees toward a self- sustaining program, the HHS Secretary may require an        
  increase in the match requirements in years 2 through 5 of the program. For the     
  purpose of the initial application's 5 year plan and budget, applicants should      
  calculate budgets based on the first year match requirements listed above.

  with DHHS, which may be an Electronic Transfer System or a Monthly Cost             
  Request System.

PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the Federal agency
  responsible for disease and injury prevention. The agency also focuses on
  prevention of disability and secondary conditions. As the Nation's prevention
  agency CDC's vision for the 21st century is "Healthy People in a Healthy World"
  reflecting the agency's concern that people's health is important both nationally
  and internationally and that the environment is critical to health in the future.
  Approximately 772 projects were funded in fiscal year 2001. Examples of the
  funded projects include: behavioral risk factor surveillance system (BRFS),
  national program of cancer registries, population based surveillance of fetal
  alcohol syndrome, grants for radiation studies and research, public health
  conference support grant program, fatality assessment and control evaluation,
  surveillance of elevated blood levels in adults, and oral health and epilepsy
  program activities. The same is anticipated for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the federal agency that has
  responsibility for prevention and monitoring of oral disease. This program
  announcement addresses the Healthy People 2010 priority areas of Oral Health
  (Chapter 21), Public Health Infrastructure (Chapter 23), and Educational and
  Community-Based Programs (Chapter 7). The purpose of this program is to
  establish, strengthen and expand the capacity of States, territories, and tribes to
  plan, implement and evaluate oral disease prevention and health promotion
  programs. These programs may address dental caries (tooth decay), periodontal
  disease, oral and pharyngeal cancers, and other oral conditions considered to be
  public health problems. In FY 2001, five states (Arkansas, Illinois, Michigan,
  Nevada, and New York), and one territory (Palau) received support under this
  program announcement.
