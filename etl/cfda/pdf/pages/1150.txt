Obligations:

Range and Average of Financial Assistance:                                             
  EPA expects cooperative agreement amounts to range between $10,000 and               
  $100,000/fiscal year; $55,000/fiscal year.                                           
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:                                                               
  Each EPA Regional Office works with their tribal partners to develop                 
  cooperative agreements. The number of DITCAs awarded on an annual basis              
  depends on the amount of available funding from Program Offices. In FY 07, 9         
  new DITCAs were awarded and 8 DITCAs were continued with additional                  
  funding. The increase in the number and funding of DITCAs is partially               
  attributable to an initiative by EPA's American Indian Environmental Office          
  (AIEO) to provide up to $200,000 per year in matching funds from FY 06 to FY         
  08 for eligible DITCAs with initial funding commitments from sponsoring              
  offices. Under this matching initiative, DITCAs were awarded in FY 07 and FY         
  08 for the following activities: Establishing a tribal pesticide circuit rider       
  program in a region to undertake core field program and enforcement activities       
  in the pesticide program, such as inspections, training, compliance assistance       
  across many tribes in that region, where a lack of such programs and authorities     
  currently exists.&#8729; Developing the capacity of Region 10 tribes to              
  implement, educate, and support activities relating to air quality compliance        
  assistance, education and public outreach, and pollution source inspection           
  activities on their reservations, relating to any applicable tribal rules, as well as
  Region 10's Federal Air Rules for Reservations in ID, WA, and OR (FARR) and          
  Title V.&#8729; Assisting EPA in implementing the federal Lead-Based Paint           
  Program under Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) on reservations in an EPA

  region. Specific tasks include lead-based paint abatement, renovation and

  remodeling and the sale and leasing of Pre-1978 housing occurring throughout

                                                                                       
  Indian Country in that region.&#8729; Assisting EPA in the implementation of         
  activities in support of Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) drinking water       
  activities in Indian Country. Conducting and completing inventories of Class V       
  wells at two reservations under EPA's Underground Injection Control (UIC)            
  Program. Class V UIC wells are the type of well most commonly found in Indian        
  Country, and include shallow disposal systems such as dry wells, septic systems,     
  and leach fields. The inventories require regulated facilities to comply with        
  certain requirements to protect underground sources of drinking water.

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  EPA may award DITCAs to fund activities for environmental programs that
  meet either one of the following criteria: (1) federal programs under
  environmental laws that clearly require EPA to directly implement in the Tribal
  context; or (2) federal programs under environmental laws that in the state
  context EPA is required to directly implement in the absence of an acceptable
  state program.Examples of DITCAs activities include: water quality standards
  promulgation and review; implementation of the National Pollutant Discharge
  Elimination System permit program under the Clean Water Act; implementation
  plan development and the Title V permit program under the Clean Air Act;
  implementation of the Public Water System Supervision program and the
  Underground Injection Control program under the Safe Drinking Water Act;
  implementation of the Underground Storage Tank program and the Subtitle C
  permit program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act;

CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
  The evaluation and selection criteria for competitive awards under this CFDA
  description will be described in the competitive announcement. Cooperative
  agreements may be awarded to Tribes which submit applications consistent with
