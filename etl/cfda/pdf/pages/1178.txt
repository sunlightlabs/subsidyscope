  The project grant will be awarded for a 1 year project period. Activities must be   
  completed within the timeframe of the project's budget period and all grants will   
  be fully funded at the time of award.                                               
Reports:                                                                              
  EPA includes reporting requirements for grants and cooperative agreements in        
  the terms and conditions of the agreements. Agreements may require interim and      
  final progress reports and financial reports. Reporting requirements are also       
  identified in the Grant Regulations Part 30 and Part 31.                            
Audits:                                                                               
  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the      
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,      
  other EPA staff, or any authorized representative of the Federal government.        
  Reviews by the EPA Project Officer and the Grants Specialist may occur each         
  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,         
  June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit                
  Organizations," non-federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in      
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that   
  year. Non-federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal         
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted    
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.                                                          
Records:                                                                              
  Financial records, including all documents to support entries on accounting         
  records and to substantiate changes to each assistance agreement must be kept       
  available to personnel authorized to examine EPA assistance accounts. All           
  records must be maintained until the expiration of three years from the date of     
  submission of the Financial Status Report. If questions still remain, such as       
  those raised as the result of an audit, related records should be retained until the
  matter is completely resolved.                                                      
Account Identification:

  In FY 2007, 74 applications were received and 20 grants were awarded. At the        
  end of these projects, OEJ anticipates the following accomplishments, outputs,      
  results achieved and services rendered from the diverse group of projects: in-      
  home trainings on Integrated Pest Management, which focus on using safer pest       
  elimination methods and reducing the number of pesticides used in the homes;        
  indoor air quality management programs to improve the indoor air quality of the     
  schools in Chicago, IL; and an analysis of the numerous environmental and           
  public health issues that confront the Hyde Park community in Richmond, GA          
  and potential remedies to resolve these issues. It is anticipated that              
  approximately 150 applications will be received in fiscal year 2008 and 40          
  awards will be granted.

RELATED PROGRAMS:
  66.306, Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative
  Agreement Program; 66.309, Surveys, Studies, Investigations and Special
  Purpose Activities Relating to Environmental Justice.
EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  (1) Training of two environmental youth organizations to identify and categorize
  contamination levels at key sites along the creek using available site histories
  and local knowledge. Based on the type and level of contamination, the groups
  will research and identify best practices for remediation of those sites as well as
  determine possible liability issues. Students will research policy barriers
  preventing the transfer of control over the identified sites to partners wishing to
  create public open space on the site. (2) Development of a health communication
  model which will provide information about ways to prevent exposure and
  reduce risk from the harm associated with the organic, chemical and heavy metal
  compounds/ substances found in fish and seafood from an Estuary System. The
  goals of the research will be to gather the necessary cultural data to: (1) increase
  awareness of fish contamination and prevention measures; (2) isolate data gaps
  in the information about the complex socio-cultural environment of fish
  consumption among the resident population; (3) develop a collaborative
  relationship between public health researchers, community advocates, and health
  care professionals serving the affected communities, and (4) acquire the
  information needed to foster behavior changes among the vulnerable populations
  at risk from potential exposure(s); (5) Creation of a one-hour documentary and
  two 20-minute documentaries on the environmental concerns associated with
  three copper mines including the history of the mines and the combined work of
  citizens and the EPA to clean up the mines; (6) Construction of a safe,
  affordable off-ground garden structure and share its designs and curriculum with
  local educators and community members wanting safe alternatives to deal with
  environmental and public health issues at the site.

66.605 PERFORMANCE PARTNERSHIP GRANTS
   (PPGs)
FEDERAL AGENCY:
  OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL
  RELATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
AUTHORIZATION:
  Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, Public Law
  104-134; Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development,
  and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1998, Public Law 105-65.
OBJECTIVES:
  Improving EPA's partnership with the states and tribes is critical to accelerating
  environmental outcomes. Performance Partnership Grants (PPGs) are the
  cornerstone of the National Environmental Performance Partnership System
  (NEPPS)- EPA's strategy to strengthen partnerships and build a results-based
  management system. PPGs are innovative grant delivery tools that allow states
  and tribes to combine up to 20 eligible program grants into a single grant with a
  single budget. PPGs can reduce administrative transaction costs, provide the
  flexibility to direct resources toward the highest priority environmental
  problems, and support cross-media approaches and initiatives. EPA's
  overarching goal is to optimize the leveraging power of PPGs to strategically
  focus on the joint priorities of EPA, states and Tribes. PPGs do not include any
  funding in addition to the state and tribal assistance grants provided under other
  statutory authorities. Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2008: The Agency's
  ongoing goals for the PPG program are to: (1) strengthen partnerships between
  EPA, the state, tribes, and interstate agencies through joint planning and priority
  setting to more effectively deploy resources; (2) provide states, tribes, and
  interstate agencies with the flexibility to direct resources where they are needed
  most to address environmental and public health priorities; (3) link program
  activities more effectively with environmental and public health goals and
  environmental outcomes; (4) foster implementation of innovative approaches
  such as pollution prevention, ecosystem management, and community-based
  environmental protection strategies; and (5) provide savings by streamlining
                                                                                     991
