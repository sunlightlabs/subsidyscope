  opened four investigations in FY 2008 and is actively pursing ongoing                
  investigations in school districts in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois,   
  Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia. These districts have significant or new       
  ELL populations. The purpose of the investigations is to ensure that ELL             
  students are receiving proper services to enable them to overcome language           
  barriers that impede equal participation in the school districts educational         
  programs. In U.S. v. Chicago Bd. of Educ. (IL), the Section filed a motion to        
  enforce the ELL provisions of the August 2006 Second Amended Consent                 
  Decree because the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) have failed to comply with           
  the following ELL provisions: (1) CPS has not demonstrated that a significant        
  number of its special education ELLs are appropriately served; (2) CPS has not       
  provided thousands of ELLs with appropriate or timely ELL services; and (3)          
                                                                                       
  CPS has failed to provide native language instruction and materials for many of

                                                                                       
  its Transitional Bilingual Education programs. At the court's direction, the

                                                                                       
  parties are negotiating the content and format of EOS' requested relief. In Lau v.

                                                                                       
  Hopp (CA), the Section is negotiating a consent decree with the San Francisco        
  Unified School District addressing outstanding ELL issues.

  Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as amended, and other Federal Laws and       
  regulations forbid discrimination in employment by private employers, labor          
  organizations, employment agencies, State and local governments and public           
  agencies. The Attorney General is authorized to sue to enjoin and remedy             
  discrimination in employment by State and local government employers under

  Title VII. Upon referral from the Department of Labor, the Attorney General is

  authorized to sue to enforce the non-discrimination in employment provisions of      
  Executive Order 11246, as amended, with respect to government contractors and        
  subcontractors. The Section also enforces against state and local government

  from discriminating or retaliating against an employee or applicant for              
  employment because of such person's past, current or future military obligation.     
  The Attorney General does not, as such, represent specific individuals, though       
  the public interest is served by obtaining relief for them through pattern or        
  practice or 706 referral lawsuits. In addition, the Civil Rights Division represents 
  other Federal agencies in challenges to laws and orders that authorize affirmative   
  action in employment, procurement and contracting on federally-assisted
