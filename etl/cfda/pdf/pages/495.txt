Preapplication Coordination:                                                       
  For Traditional Application Process (TAP) before the application is filed, the   
  sponsor has a preapplication conference with local HUD Multifamily Hub and       
  Program Center Staff. For Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) there is      
  no preapplication stage for Section 223(f). The MAP-approved lender prepares     
  and submits the application for a Firm Commitment, including a full              
  underwriting package for HUD Multifamily Hub or Program Center review.           
  This program is excluded from coverage under OMB Circular No. A-102 and

  E.O. 12372.                                                                      
Application Procedure:

  The applicant will submit a formal application for conditional or firm           
  commitment through a HUD approved mortgagee. This program is excluded

  from coverage under OMB Circular No. A-110. An environmental assessment          
  is required.                                                                     
Award Procedure:                                                                   
  The local HUD Multifamily Hub and Program Center reviews the application to      
  determine proposal eligibility. If the project meets program requirements, the   
  local HUD Multifamily Hub and Program Center issues the commitment to the        
  lender to insure the project.                                                    
Deadlines:                                                                         
  Deadlines are established on a case-by-case basis.                               
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:                                                
  Processing time depends on the degree of preparation of the sponsor, and         
  whether MAP or TAP is used.                                                      
Appeals:                                                                           
  If an application for mortgage insurance is denied, HUD will state the reasons   
  for denial.

  The term of a commitment to insure may be extended under certain

Reports:
