  eligible applicants consistent with the Agency's Assistance Agreement             
  Competition Policy. Applicants need not be located within the boundaries of the   
  EPA regional office to be eligible to apply for funding but must propose projects 
  that affect the States, Tribes, and Territories within the Region.

Preapplication Coordination:                                                        
  Each EPA Regional Office will set up its own competitive process for awarding     
  WPDGs. Interested applicants should review information on the WPDG at:            
  http://www.epa.gov/owow/wetlands/grantguidelines/. Regarding pre-                 
  application/pre-proposal assistance with respect to competitive funding           
  opportunities under this program description, EPA will generally specify the      
  nature of the pre-application/pre-proposal assistance, if any, that will be       
  available to applicants in the competitive announcement. For additional           
  information, contact the individual(s) listed as "Information Contacts" or see    
  Appendix IV of the Catalog. This program is eligible for coverage under E.O.      
  12372, "Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs." An applicant should        
  consult the office or official designated as the single point of contact in his or
  her State for more information on the process the State requires to be followed in
  applying for assistance, if the State has selected the program for review.        
Application Procedure:                                                              
  Each EPA Regional Office will establish a process for awarding WPDGs.             
  Regional Offices will accept applications only for projects selected through the  
  competitive process that affect the States, Tribes, and Territories within their  
  Region. The standard application forms, as furnished by the Federal agency and    
  required by OMB Circular No. A-102, must be used for this program.                
  Applicants can also receive a copy of the current announcement by calling the     
  EPA Regional Coordinator. Application forms are available at                      
  http://www.epa.gov/ogd/AppKit/index.htm and by mail upon request to the

  Grant applications are reviewed by the appropriate EPA Regional Office and, if

Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:                                                 
  Grants are usually approved within 4 months of receipt of completed               
  application.                                                                      
Appeals:                                                                            
  Assistance agreement competition-related disputes will be resolved in             
  accordance with the dispute resolution procedures published in 70 FR (Federal     
  Register) 3629, 3630 (January 26, 2005). Copies of these procedures may also      
  be requested by contacting the individual(s) listed as "Information Contacts."    
  Disputes relating to matters other than the competitive selection of recipients   
  will be resolved under 40 CFR 30.63 or 40 CFR 31.70, as applicable.               
Renewals:                                                                           
  None.                                                                             
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                  
  This program has no statutory formula. The applicant must provide a minimum       
  of 25 percent of the total cost of the work plan to the extent allowed by 40 CFR  
  31.24, 35.385, and 35.615. To determine if the minimum match is met, EPA          
  will use the following formula: amount ( in dollars) of federal funds requested   
  from EPA divided by 3 = minimum match (in dollars) or Total project costs         
  divided by 4 = minimum match (in dollars). For example, if the applicant          
  requests $75,000 of federal funds or a Total project cost of $100,000 for the     
  three-year project period, it must be able to provide $25,000 in matching funds   
  or services. A reduced match may be available for Tribal grantees that place the  
  Wetland Program Development Grant funds in a Performance Partnership Grant.       
   (See regulations at 40 CFR 536(c).) Please contact your EPA Regional contact     


                                                                               11-08
  person listed in Section VII if you have any questions about calculating the
  match requirement. We encourage States and Tribes to provide a larger share of
  the project's cost whenever possible (i.e., in excess of the required 25 percent of
  total project costs).Award recipients can meet the match requirement with in-
  kind or monetary contributions from entities other than themselves. However,
  other Federal money cannot be used as the match for this grant program unless
  authorized by the statute governing the award of the other Federal funds.
  Matching funds are considered grant funds. They must be used for the
  reasonable and necessary expenses of carrying out the assistance agreement
  work plan. Any restrictions on the use of grant funds (i.e., prohibition of land
  acquisition with grant funds) also apply to the matching funds.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  The terms of the grant shall be determined at time of grant award.
Reports:
  At a minimum annual interim and final progress and expenditure reports and at a
  maximum quarterly interim and final progress and expenditure reports; program
  evaluations; and other reports as required by the specific terms of the agreement.
Audits:
  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,
  other EPA staff, or any authorized representative of the Federal government.
  Reviews by the EPA Project Officer and the Grants Specialist may occur each
  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,
  June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit
  Organizations," non-federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that
  year. Non-federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.
Records:
  Financial records, including all documents to support entries on accounting
  records and to substantiate changes to each grant, must be kept available to
  personnel authorized to examine EPA grant accounts. All records must be
  maintained until expiration of three years from the date of submission of the
  final expenditure report. If questions still remain, such as those raised as a result
  of audit, related records should be retained until the matter is completely
  resolved.
Account Identification:
  68-0103-0-1-304; STAG.
Obligations:
  FY 07 $9,300,000; FY 08 $15,829,000; and FY 09 est. $15,800,000.
Range and Average of Financial Assistance:
  $25,000 to $500,000/fiscal year; $253,500/fiscal year.
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  Each of the ten EPA Regional Offices issues a competitive announcement based
  on available funds and Agency priorities. The number of applications and the
  number of awards made is dependent on the competitive announcement issued.
  The announcements include the number of anticipated awards. In FY 07,
  approximately 5 to 20 proposal were received by each Region under the ten
  Regional competitive announcements with approximately 3 to 11 cooperative
  agreements or grants to be awarded under each Regional competitive
  announcements. No awards were made non-competitively in FY 07. In FY 07,
  projects were funded to support activities such as development of plans and
  management tools for protection of wetland resources; advancing the science
  and technical tools for evaluating, protecting, and restoring wetland health;
  facilitating development of watershed stakeholder partnerships; and improving
  public access to and education about wetlands information. Until this date, no
  awards were made non-competitively in FY 08. In FY08, competitions and
  awards are yet to be determined.
