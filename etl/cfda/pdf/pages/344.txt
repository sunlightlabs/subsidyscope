  watershed projects. This program provides technical and financial assistance to    
  State agencies and units of local government in solving problems caused by         
  flooding, erosion and sediment damage, conservation, development, utilization,     
  and disposal of water, including the development of multipurpose facilities for    
  such uses as recreation, improvement of fish and wild-life habitat, irrigation, and
  water supply to municipal and industrial users.

  reclamation, biofuels, and wildlife food and cover. The annual commercial
  production of NRCS released grasses, legumes and woody plants by commercial
  seed growers and nurserymen is equivalent to the amount required to establish
  vegetative cover on over 2,000,000 acres of land.
