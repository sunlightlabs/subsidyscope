OBJECTIVES:                                                                         
  To serve investors who complain about investment fraud or the mishandling of      
  their investments by securities professionals. To respond to a wide range of      
  investor inquiries, produce and distribute educational materials, and organize    
  investor education events. To advise the SEC and its staff about problems         
  frequently encountered by investors and possible solutions. To represent the      
  interests of individual investors in connection with SEC rule-making              
  proceedings.                                                                      
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                
  Dissemination of Technical Information; Investigation of Complaints.              
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                          
  Investor complaints provide an important source of information about possible     
  securities laws violations and can assist the SEC in its law enforcement and      
  regulatory functions. Investors who believe that possible securities laws         
  violations have occurred should advise the SEC so that it may take appropriate    
  regulatory action. However, the SEC is not a collection agency. It does not       
  advise investors whether particular transactions about which they may have        
  complained violate the federal securities laws, nor does it seek recovery on      
  behalf of investors through court action or otherwise. These laws do provide      
  important remedies to investors, and investors should consider seeking the        
  advice of an attorney as to any recourse available to them if they believe they   
  have been defrauded.                                                              
Applicant Eligibility:                                                              
  Anyone may seek information from or file a complaint with the SEC.                
Beneficiary Eligibility:                                                            
  The SEC's actions are designed to protect not only those who seek its help        
  directly, but also all other similarly situated investors and the general public. 
  Moreover, the SEC's public files contain financial and other information about    
  several thousand companies, broker-dealers, investment companies, investment      
  advisers, transfer agents, and banks. Members of the public may examine such      
  material at the SEC's headquarters office in Washington, DC, or they may order    
  copies of the material by contacting the SEC at: Public Reference Branch, Mail    
  Stop 1-2, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Telephone: (202) 942-      
  8090. Fax: (202) 628-9001. Email: publicinfo@sec.gov. The SEC also                
  maintains a web site on the internet at www.sec.gov where the public can read or  
  download public files on public companies whose securities are registered with    
  the SEC, educational information, and investor alerts. Also, investors who        
  believe they have been defrauded, or believe that another party has violated the  
  federal securities laws are urged to present their complaint and/or information to
  the SEC for use in its enforcement and regulatory activities. SEC public actions  
  do not necessarily result in any monetary benefits to investors. However,         
  aggrieved investors may find the information the SEC discloses in its actions     
  helpful in any private action they may bring to recover their losses.
