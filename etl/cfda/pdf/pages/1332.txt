  monthly payment amount paid over a period of 12 to 30 years, depending on the      
  amount owed; (3) a graduated repayment plan with a monthly payment that will       
  increase generally every 2 years. The repayment period varies from 12 to 30        
  years, depending on the amount owed; and (4) except for Direct PLUS Loan           
  borrowers, an income contingent repayment (ICR) plan with a monthly payment        
  that is adjusted annually based on the income of the borrower and paid over a      
  extended period of time not to exceed 25 years. Any unpaid balance remaining       
  after 25 years in the ICR plan is forgiven by the Secretary of Education.          
  However, under current IRS rules, the amount written off is considered taxable     
  income to the borrower in the year it is written off. A legislative change         
  removing this taxable treatment has been sought. CCRAA created a new               
  income-based repayment plan for those borrowers meting a standard of "partial      
  financial hardship" based on their annual repayment amount in relation to their    
  adjusted gross income. Generally a borrower would not have to repay on a           
  monthly basis more than 15 percent of their discretionary income. Any              
  outstanding balance would be forgiven after 25 years of repayment in the           
  income-based repayment option. CCRAA also created a new loan forgiveness           
  program for Direct Loan borrowers who work in public service during a 10-year      
  period while they are repaying their loans. If these borrowers druing repayment    
  have an outstanding loan balance after 10 years of working in public service, the  
  Federal Government will forgive the remaining balance on behalf of the             
  borrower. Public service may include a variety of public disciplines such as       
  education, health, law, military service and public safety.
