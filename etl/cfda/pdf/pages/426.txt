  Careers Organization covering seven (7) internships, after an open competition     
  which closed October 5, 1998, in response to a Federal Register Notice             
  published August 25, 1998, Vol 63, #164, p. 45223-45227. Additional grants

  12/31/01 a grant covering 4 new interns and extending 5 others was issued. A       
  grant was issued on September 30, 2002 to Environmental Careers Organization       
  covering seven twenty (20) new) internships and extending sixteen (16)             
  Internships, after an open competition which closed June 10, 2002, in response

OBJECTIVES:                                                                          
  To continue development of a program aimed at increasing research and              
  educational partnerships between NOAA and Minority Serving Institutions.           
  Partnerships are achieved through collaboration with NOAA Cooperative              
  Science Centers in atmospheric, oceanic, environmental sciences, environmental     
  technology, and remote sensing. An Environmental Entrepreneurship Program          
  has been implemented to support restoration projects in environmentally            
  depleted zones and program development in NOAA-related sciences at minority        
  serving institutions.                                                              
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                 
  Project Grants (Cooperative Agreements).                                           
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                           
  Funds may be used to support a distinguished professor, research, development      
  programs and students undertaking course work and/or research in NOAA              
  related sciences at minority serving institutions.                                 
Applicant Eligibility:                                                               
  Applicants are defined as qualified minority serving institutions based on the     
  2003 United States Department of Education definition of minority serving          
  institutions. Non-minority institutions may also participate in this program       
  when partnered with a minority serving institution. Institutions applying to be    
  considered a designated Cooperative Science Center in atmospheric, oceanic and     
  environmental sciences, environmental technology and remote sensing must           
  have a graduate program in the respective category.                                
Beneficiary Eligibility:                                                             
  The benefits to the Nation are an increased number of academic institutions        
  capable of providing services and products in support of the agency's mission to   
  describe and predict changes in the environment, and to conserve and manage        
  the nation's coastal and marine resources to ensure sustainable economic           
  opportunities. Collaboration among NOAA and academic institutions will not         
  only increase the number of trained professionals in the NOAA related sciences,    
  it will also lead to a larger number of institutions participating in collaborative


                                                                                11-08

  and social sciences that support the agency's mission. To date, NOAA has hired
  24 students from underrepresented communities in FTE positions since the
  program began in FY 2001. Twelve of these hires are Ph.D., and twelve are MS
  students. In addition, 15 Ph.D., 69 MS and 192 BS degree students have
