  Business concerns are generally considered to be affiliates of one another when       
  either directly or indirectly, (a) one concern controls or has the power to control   
  the other; or (b) a third-party/parties controls or has the power to control both.    
  STTR grants which "partner" with a research institution in cooperative research       
  and development. At least 40 percent of the project is to be performed by the         
  small business concern and at least 30 percent by the research institution. In both   
  Phase I and Phase II, the research must be performed in the U.S. and its              
  possessions. To be eligible for funding, a grant application must be approved for     
  scientific merit and program relevance by a scientific review group and a             
  national advisory council.                                                            
Beneficiary Eligibility:                                                                
  Health professionals, graduate students, health professional students, scientists,    
  and researchers, any nonprofit or for-profit organization, company, or institution    
  engaged in biomedical research. Project Grants: Although no degree of                 
  education is either specified or required, nearly all successful applicants have      
  doctoral degrees in one of the sciences or professions. NRSAs: Predoctoral            
  awardees must have completed the baccalaureate degree and postdoctoral

  postdoctoral training must include the candidate¿s academic record, research          
  experience, citizenship, institutional sponsorship, and the proposed area and

  postdoctoral training must show the objectives, methodology and resources for         
  the research training program; the qualifications and experience of directing         
  staff; the criteria to be used in selecting individuals for stipend support; and a    
  detailed budget and justification for the amount of grant funds requested.            
  Costs will be determined in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-87 for State           
  and local governments. For-profit organizations' costs are determined in              
  accordance with Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. For other        
  grantees, costs will be determined in accordance with HHS Regulations 45 CFR,         
  Part 74, Subpart Q. For SBIR and STTR grants, applicant organization (small           
  business concern) must present in a research plan an idea that has potential for      
  commercialization and furnish evidence that scientific competence,                    
  experimental methods, facilities, equipment, and funds requested are appropriate      
  to carry out the plan. Grant form PHS 398 is used to apply for SBIR and STTR
