OBJECTIVES:
  The Federal Seed Program prevents mislabeled seed from moving in interstate
  commerce by providing for random sampling of seeds to insure accurate labeling
  of seed characteristics. The Plant Variety Protection Program offers legal
  protection to developers of new varieties of plants which reproduce by providing
  the equivalent of a patent to the plant's developer. The Research and Promotion
  Programs provide for the collection of an assessment for each commodity
  covered by statutes to enable the commodity industries to carry out research and
  promotion activities. It is the responsibility of the Agricultural Marketing
  Service to assure responsible use of these assessments in meeting the research
  and promotion objective. The Dairy and Tobacco Adjustment Act authorized
  the establishment of a National dairy promotion research and nutrition education
  program. To eliminate deceptive, unfair and fraudulent trade practices in the
  processing and marketing of food and agricultural products; provide assistance
  to those striving to achieve this objective. The Pesticide Data Program works
  with participating States to collect and analyze data on pesticide use and residue
  levels for selected commodities in the nation's food supply. This program
  provides statistically based data to Federal agencies for use in making policy
  decisions for regulatory and educational purposes.
