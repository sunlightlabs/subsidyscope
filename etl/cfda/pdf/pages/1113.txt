  respondents and 46% of the assistance provider community respondents              
  indicated an environmental improvement from actions taken as a result of using    
  a Center. The EPA funded 12 Centers and Center Services under 10 cooperative

  agreements in FY 2007 and FY 2008. Each Center addresses real world issues        
  in language that speaks to the regulated entities. Through internet Websites,     
  telephone assistance lines, fax-back systems, and e-mail discussion groups, the

  Centers are helping businesses, local governments, and federal facilities         
  understand and comply with federal environmental requirements and save            
  money through pollution prevention techniques. In FY 2008, EPA awarded            
  funding for the development of a Center for the food processing industry.         
REGULATIONS, GUIDELINES, AND LITERATURE:

  Federal employees; and human health studies (taking blood or other information
  from humans).
Applicant Eligibility:
  For certain competitive funding opportunities under this CFDA description, the
  Agency may limit eligibility to compete to a number or subset of eligible
  applicants consistent with the Agency's Assistance Agreement Competition
  Policy. An eligible applicant MUST BE: (1) a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
  as designated by the Internal Revenue Service OR a nonprofit organization,
  recognized by the State, territory, commonwealth, or tribe in which it is located,
  which addresses local environmental and public health issues; AND (2) located

  impacted by environmental harms and risks and has a local environmental
  and/or public health issue that is identified in the proposal. *Generally, a quasi-

  agency, but is not considered a part of the government agency; (2) was created
  by the government agency but is exempt from certain legal and administrative
  requirements imposed on government agencies; or (3) was not created by the
  government agency but performs a public purpose and is significantly supported
  financially by the government agency.
