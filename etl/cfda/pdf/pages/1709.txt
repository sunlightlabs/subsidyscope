  To support eye and vision research projects that address the leading causes of
  blindness and impaired vision in the U.S. These include retinal diseases; corneal
  diseases; cataract; glaucoma and optic neuropathies; strabismus; amblyopia; and
  low vision and blindness rehabilitation. To increase understanding of the normal
  development and function of the visual system in order to better prevent,
  diagnose, and treat sight-threatening conditions; and, to enhance the
  rehabilitation, training, and quality of life of individuals who are partially-
  sighted or blind. To support a broad program of basic vision research through
  grants and cooperative agreements; to encourage high quality clinical research,
  including clinical trials, other epidemiologic studies, and health services
  research; to encourage research training and career development in the sciences
  related to vision; and to sponsor scientific workshops in high priority research
  areas to encourage exchange of information among scientists. Small Business
  Innovation Research (SBIR) program: To increase private sector
  commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research and
  development; to encourage small business participation in Federal research and
  development; and to foster and encourage participation of socially and
  economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned small
  business concerns in technological innovation. Small Business Technology
  Transfer (STTR) program: To stimulate and foster scientific and technological
  innovation through cooperative research development carried out between small
  business concerns and research institutions; to foster technology transfer
  between small business concerns and research institutions; to increase private
  sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research and
  development; and to foster and encourage participation of socially and
  economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned small
  business concerns in technological innovation.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Project Grants.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  Research grants and cooperative agreements provide funds for salaries,
  consultant costs, equipment, supplies, travel, patient costs, alterations and
  renovations, other expenses, and consortium/contractual costs. The scientists
  and institutions are under an obligation to expend grant funds prudently for the
  purposes as stated in the application and award document. The Conference
  Cooperative Agreement supports scientific meetings and workshops in high
  priority research areas to encourage exchange of information among scientists.
  The Center Core Grant is intended to enhance an institution's environment and
  capability to conduct vision research, to facilitate collaborative studies of the
  visual system and its disorders, and to attract scientists of diverse disciplines to
  research on the visual system. Career development awards include the Mentored
  Clinical Scientist Development Award, Mentored Patient-Oriented Research
  Career Development Award, Institutional Clinical Scientist Development
  Program, and the Mid-career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research.
