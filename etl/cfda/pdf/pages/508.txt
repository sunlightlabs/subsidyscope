  No mandatory applicant match requirements. A coordinator position may be           
  fully funded from appropriated funds or in combination with the development's      
  residual receipts or surplus cash/excess income. Such combination of funds         
  must be used when the development has some limited resources to fund the           
  coordinator position, but not enough to provide funding on a continuing basis. In  
  this instance, the owner/borrowers' funds would be listed in the funding request   
  and must be used first. Developments with sufficient project funds to fully fund   
  a coordinator are not eligible to receive grant funds.
