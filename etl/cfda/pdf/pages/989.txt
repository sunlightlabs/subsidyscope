  NASA's Aerospace Education Services Program (AESP) is a specialized group        
  of educators using NASA's unique assets to support local, state, regional and    
  national mathematics, science, and technology education systemic change efforts  
  through collaboration of internal and external stakeholders in high-impact       
  activities. This well-trained, well-informed and well-equipped workforce uses    
  the NASA Mission and Vision to support increased instruction in mathematics,     
  science, and technology content, enhance pedagogical skills, and address equity  
  issues.

  AESP provides in-service and preservice workshops for K-12 teachers to initiate  
  dramatic and enduring education systemic change that directly impacts teaching   
  and learning science, mathematics, and technology in existing classrooms. AESP

  Specialists support and complement teacher training by visiting in individual

  classrooms to model and assist teachers in implementing the strategies           
  demonstrated in teacher workshops. Programs cannot be used where there are       
  commercial overtones, for promotional purposes, or where admission is charged.

AUTHORIZATION:
  National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, Section 203(a) (3), as amended,
  Public Law 85-568, 42 U.S.C. 2473.
OBJECTIVES:
  To insure that technologies resulting from Government-sponsored civilian
  aerospace research and development are made available to the widest extent
  practicable and appropriate for the Nation's benefit.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Dissemination of Technical Information.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  Discoveries, innovations, inventions, and improvements developed throughout
  the aeronautics and space program are brought to the attention of private
  industry, academic institutions, and Federal, State and local government
  organizations in several ways. These technologies can be accessed with NASA's
  TechTracS data system via the Internet. NASA Tech Briefs is a monthly
  periodical with an industrial readership of approximately 500,000 containing
  articles which describe such innovations. Subscription is currently free to
  qualified engineers, scientists and business people in U.S. industry and to
  technology transfer agents. NASA technology transfer offices at NASA field
  centers work with public sector organizations, medical institutions, industry
  associations and others to identify problems of national scope and significance
  suitable for joint-sponsored NASA/industry applications engineering projects.
  The objective of such projects is to apply or otherwise adapt existing aerospace
  technology to meet identified non- aerospace needs in the public and private
  sectors of the Nation's economy.
Applicant Eligibility:
  Engineers and managers of domestic enterprises, professionals, and others
  involved in technology transfer are entitled to free subscriptions to NASA Tech
  Briefs. Technical information search and retrieval services beyond that available
  via the Internet (http://www.nasatech.com), and NASA-owned computer
  programs/documentation are available to domestic organizations on a free or
  paying basis. Technology Transfer products are available to those who can
  demonstrate a national public need and would be served by applying NASA
  technology.
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  U.S. industry will benefit.
