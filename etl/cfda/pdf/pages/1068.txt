  Initial application for determination of basic eligibility may be made on VA

  Form 26-4555 to the VA regional office holding the veteran's claim folder. After  
  eligibility is determined, a VA employee will personally assist the veteran       
  throughout subsequent processing, including advice on a suitable house plan and   
  lot, adaptive features, location of a qualified architect and builder, and        
  submission of the documents necessary for final grant approval.                   
Award Procedure:                                                                    
  The VA Regional Office releases the grant proceeds after conditions of the        
  contract and grant approval are fulfilled.                                        
Deadlines:                                                                          
  None.                                                                             
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:                                                 
  Initial interview completed within 40 days of determination of eligibility. Grant 
  approval timeline varies and is dependent upon veteran's desires to move          
  forward with securing contractors and drafting construction plans.                
Appeals:                                                                            
  Denial of eligibility is appealable through the Board of Veterans' Appeals. In the
  event of a denial, claimants are advised of appeal rights and procedures at the   
  time of notification.                                                             
Renewals:                                                                           
  Not applicable.                                                                   
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                  
  For a SAH grant, VA provides 50 percent of the cost to the veteran of the         
  housing unit, land, fixtures and allowable expenses, not to exceed a maximum      
  grant of $50,000. For a SHA grant, VA provides the lesser of (1) the actual cost  
  of adaptations, or (2) $10,000.

  sum. In remodeling and construction cases, the grant is released by specified     
  construction completion phases approved by VA.
