Preapplication Coordination:                                                        
  EPA awards grants and cooperative agreements supporting research,                 
  development, monitoring, public education, training, demonstrations, and          
  studies based on competitive applications submitted in response to EPA            
  solicitations, considering relevance and likelihood of success of proposed        
  projects. When making competitive awards, EPA will specify the nature of the      
  pre-application assistance, if any, that will be available to applicants in the   
  Requests for Initial Proposals or Requests for Applications. For this reason, we  
  recommend that potential applicants discuss proposed projects with or submit      
  pre-applications to staff in the appropriate EPA technical program offices. See   
  Appendix IV of the Catalog. This program is eligible for coverage under E.O.      
  12372, "Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs." An applicant should        
  consult the office or official designated as the single point of contact in his or
  her State for more information on the process the State requires to be followed in
  applying for assistance, if the State has selected the program for review.        
  Regarding pre-application/pre-proposal assistance with respect to competitive     
  funding opportunities under this program description, EPA will generally specify  
  the nature of the pre-application/pre-proposal assistance, if any, that will be   
  available to applicants in the competitive announcement. For additional           
  information, contact the individual(s) listed as "Information Contacts" or see    
  Appendix IV of the Catalog.                                                       
Application Procedure:                                                              
  The standard application forms as furnished by the Federal agency and required    
  by OMB Circular No. A-102 and A-110 must be used for this program. EPA            
  requires final applications to be made on Standard Form 424. Application kits     
  should be requested from and submitted to the Environmental Protection            
  Agency, Grants and Interagency Agreements Management Division, 3903R,             
  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N. W., Washington, DC 20460 or the appropriate

  information and assistance, including and application kit, required forms, and a  
  check list may also be found at: http//www.epa..gov/ogd/AppKit/. For              
  competitive awards, Requests for Initial Proposals or Requests for Applications   
  will specify application procedures. Applicants may be able to use                
  http://www.grants.gov to electronically apply for certain grant opportunities     
  under this CFDA.                                                                  
Award Procedure:                                                                    
  For non-competitive awards, EPA will conduct an administrative evaluation to      
  determine the adequacy of the application in relation to grant regulations and to 
  technical and program evaluation to determine the merit and relevance of the      
  project. The Agency will then advise the applicant if funding is being            
  considered. A final work plan will then be negotiated with the applicant. For     
  competitive awards, EPA will review and evaluate applications, proposals,         
  and/or submissions in accordance with the terms, conditions, and criteria stated  
  in the competitive announcement. Competitions will be conducted in accordance     
  with EPA policies/regulations for competing assistance agreements.

  For competitive awards, deadlines will be specified in Request for Applications   
  or Request for Initial Proposals. Contact your HQ or Regional Office for          
  application deadlines.

Appeals:                                                                            
  Assistance agreement competition-related disputes will be resolved in             
  accordance with the dispute resolution procedures published in 70 FR (Federal     
  Register) 3629, 3630 (January 26, 2005). Copies of these procedures may also      
  be requested by contacting the individual(s) listed as "Information Contacts."    
  Disputes relating to matters other than the competitive selection of recipients   
  will be resolved under 40 CFR 30.63 or 40 CFR 31.70, as applicable.               
Renewals:                                                                           
  None. Generally, EPA incrementally funds grants and cooperative agreements        
  for research, development, monitoring, public education, training,                
  demonstrations and studies. Approval of subsequent funding increments is          
  dependent on satisfactory project progress, continued relevance of the project to 
  EPA's priorities, and availability of funds, and the Agency policy on the         
  competitive grant process.                                                        
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                  
  Not applicable.                                                                   
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                              
  EPA normally funds grants and cooperative agreements on a 12-month basis.         
  However, EPA can negotiate the project period with each applicant based on        
  project requirements. Funds are released by a letter of credit.                   
Reports:                                                                            
  EPA includes reporting requirements for grants and cooperative agreements in      
  the terms and conditions of the agreements. Agreements may require quarterly,     
  interim, and final progress reports, and financial, equipment, and invention      
  reports. Reporting requirements are also identified in the Grant Regulations, 40  
  CFR Parts 30 and Part 31.                                                         
Audits:
