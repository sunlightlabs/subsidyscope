  districts, individual properties, and National Historic Landmarks nominated       
  because of the Historic Preservation Fund Grants-in-Aid Program. Since 1968,

  Trust, and Tribes. Over 850 subgrants were awarded by 59 State and Territorial    
  grantees in Fiscal Year 2003. These categorical matching grants administered      
  by the National Park Service provide partial funding support to State Historic    
  Preservation Offices (SHPOs) in carrying out statutory responsibilities under the 
  National Historic Preservation Act, as amended, for the following types of        
  activities: (1) conducting a comprehensive survey of historic properties (12.4    
  million acres and 123,000 properties assessed) and maintaining inventories of     
  information gained from such survey; (2) nominating properties to the National    
  Register of Historic Places (1,450 nominations); (3) assisting and advising       
  Federal and State agencies and local governments in carrying out their historic   
  preservation responsibilities (e.g., 105,000 Federal projects reviewed); (5)      
  cooperating with local governments in developing local historic preservation      
  programs (total of 1,431 Certified Local Governments (CLGs); and (6) advising     
  and assisting in the evaluation of proposals for rehabilitation projects that may 
  qualify for Federal tax incentives (e.g., 3,400 Federal Tax Credit applications
