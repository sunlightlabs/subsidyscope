  To assist local organizations, especially watershed groups, to begin actual          
  construction projects to clean streams impacted by AMD. Lands and water              
  eligible for reclamation or drainage abatement expenditures under Section 404        
  of Public Law 95-87 are those which were mined for coal or which were affected       
  by such mining, wastebanks, coal processing, or other coal mining processes,         
  except as provided for under Section 411 of Public Law 95-87, prior to August        
  3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under

  eligible for remining shall not affect the eligibility of such lands for reclamation 
  and restoration under this title after the release of the bond or deposit for any    
  such operation as provided under Section 509. In the event the bond or deposit       
  for a surface coal mining operation on lands eligible for remining is forfeited,     
  funds available under this title may be used if the amount of such bond or           
  deposit is not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement,          
  except that if conditions warrant, the secretary shall immediately exercise his      
  authority under Section 410.

RELATED PROGRAMS:
  15.252, Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) Program.
EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  In one project, the site has 30 miles of streams, with 17 miles severely impacted
  by drainage from abandoned coal mines in the watershed. Two different
  limestone treatment systems were used. With the first system limestone was
  added to the streams and two windmills that operated air pumps pumping air
  into the water causing the metals to fall out of solution. The second system was
  an underground anoxic limestone drain that the acidic water flows through
  dissolving the limestone in the water and raising the pH enough cause the metals
  to fall out in the wetlands.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
