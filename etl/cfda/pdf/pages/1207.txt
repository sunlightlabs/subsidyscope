Preapplication Coordination:                                                          
  This program is eligible for coverage under E.O. 12372, "Intergovernmental          
  Review of Federal Programs." An applicant should consult the office or official     
  designated as the single point of contact in his or her State for more information  
  on the process the State requires to be followed in applying for assistance, if the 
  State has selected the program for review. Tribes and Intertribal Consortia are     
  not required to follow intergovernmental review procedures.                         
Application Procedure:                                                                
  States and Tribes apply for funds through EPA regional offices. Applicants may      
  be able to use http://www.grants.gov to electronically apply for certain grant      
  opportunities under this CFDA. EPA may award combined or separate                   
  cooperative agreements/grants for leak prevention.                                  
Award Procedure:                                                                      
  These funds are awarded non-competitively. Applications will be subjected to        
  administrative evaluation to determine the adequacy of application in relation to   
  assistance agreement regulations and to technical and program evaluation to         
  determine the merit and relevance of the project. The Agency will advise the        
  applicant if funding is being considered. A final work plan will be negotiated      
  with the applicant. A cooperative agreement or grant must be signed between         
  EPA and the State or Territory or EPA and the Tribe or Intertribal Consortia.       
  EPA awards the cooperative agreement or grant to states through a previously        
  established allocation process, issued under national guidance rather than          
  through competition(see 40 CFR 35.332 and EPA Order 5700.5, Section                 
  6(c)(1)).                                                                           
Deadlines:                                                                            
  Proposals generally must be received prior to May 15 for funding in the             
  applicable fiscal year.                                                             
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:                                                   
  Generally, from 3 to 4 months.                                                      
Appeals:                                                                              
  Disputes will be resolved under 40 CFR 30.63 or 40 CFR 31.70, as applicable.        
Renewals:                                                                             
  Contact the appropriate Regional Office. See

Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                    
  The UST Solid Waste Disposal Act 2007(f) grant program has no statutory             
  formula or matching requirement. However, there is a 25 percent matching            
  requirement (cost share) for States under 40 CFR 35.335. State matches (cost        
  shares) may include in-kind contributions. There is no matching (cost share)        
  requirement for grants to Tribes or Intertribal Consortia under Public Law 105-     
  276. Under 40 CFR 35,332 and 40 CFR 35.732, EPA regions allocate funds to           
  states and tribes based on their programmatic needs and applicable EPA              
  guidance. Factors include the number of active federally regulated underground      
  storage tanks. Each fiscal year through FY 2006 states generally received           
  approximately $187,000 each and the territories received approximately $80,000      
  each. Tribes receive lower amounts based on need and the number of                  
  underground storage tanks. LUST prevention funding is awarded under Section         
  9011 and other applicable provisions of Subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal      
  Act subject to an allocation process developed by the Agency. The Agency            
  distributes funds based on the number of federally-regulated USTs in a State and    
  other indicators of State needs. States will provide a 25 percent match (cost       
  share) for cooperative agreements awarded under Section 9011 and other              
  applicable provisions of Subtitle I. If EPA awards a State a combined UST grant     
  and a LUST prevention cooperative agreement, the 25 percent cost share will         
  apply to total project costs for the combined agreement. There is no matching       
  requirement (cost share) for LUST prevention cooperative agreements for Tribes      
  or Intertribal Consortia awarded pursuant to annual appropriation acts.             
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                                
  The terms of the grant shall be determined at the time of the grant award by the    
  specific EPA Regional Office. Grants are generally awarded on either single-year    
  or two-year basis.                                                                  
Reports:                                                                              
  Reporting requirements are identified at 40 CFR Parts 30 and 31. EPA Regional       
  Offices may include additional information regarding the content and frequency      
  of reporting requirements in the terms and conditions of the agreements.            
Audits:                                                                               
  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the      
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,      
  other EPA staff, or any authorized representative of the Federal government.        
  Reviews by the EPA Project Officer and the Grants Specialist may occur each         
  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,         
  June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit                
  Organizations," non-federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in      
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that   
  year. Non-federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal         
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted    
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.                                                          
Records:

  applicable depending upon the identity of the recipient. Financial records,
  including all documents to support entries on accounting records and to
  substantiate changes to each grant must be kept available to personnel
  authorized to examine EPA grant accounts. All records must be maintained until
  expiration of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure
  report. If questions still remain, such as those raised as a result of audit, related
  records should be retained until the matter is completely resolved.

PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  For FY 2007, 49 states, six territories and approximately 10 Indian Tribes
  submitted assistance agreement applications and were awarded assistance
  agreements. In FY 07, results achieved were measured by the annual percent
  increase (+1 percent) of UST facilities that were in significant operational
  compliance with both release detection and release prevention (spill, overflow,
  and corrosion protection requirements). At the end of FY 2007, EPA did meet its
  goal of a one percent increase of UST facilities in operational compliance with
  both release detection and release prevention (spill, overfill, and corrosion
  protection) requirements. In FY 2007, EPA met and exceeded its goal of
  reducing the number of confirmed UST releases nationally to less than 10,000.
  FY 2008 is the first year LUST funds are available for release prevention
  purposes.

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  State and/or Tribal Governments' Grants funded projects include functions
  necessary for the development and/or implementation of a State or Indian
  underground storage tank (UST) program. Those functions that may be
  accepted for funding include the development and/or implementation of
  enforcement and inspection programs, outreach, and training related to the
  underground storage tanks program. Specific examples of funded projects in FY
  2007 were: (1) Corrosion testing and training for field inspectors; (2) Red Tag
  Enforcement Tools for states to obtain UST compliance from owners/operators;
  (3) Web-based training for UST owners/operators; (4) Photograph records of
  USTs in large states, such as Montana; and (5) Third-party inspection programs
  to more efficiently conduct compliance inspections at UST facilities. These
  grants may also be used for EPA to help states, who request it, to obtain SEE
  enrollees through a SEE grant to work on the state's underground storage tanks
  (UST) and to support direct UST implementation programs. This is a new
  authority for use of LUST funds for prevention. Specific examples of funded
  projects will be: inspections, enforcement, development of regulations and other
  program infrastructure.
