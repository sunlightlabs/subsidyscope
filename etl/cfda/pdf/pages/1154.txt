  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the       
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,       
  other EPA staff, or any authorized representative of the Federal government.         
  Reviews by the EPA Project Officer and the Grants Specialist may occur each          
  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,          
  June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit                 
  Organizations," non-federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in       
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that    
  year. Non-federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal          
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted     
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.                                                           
Records:

  FY 07 $0; FY 08 $0; and FY 09 $0 for financial assistance awarded under              
  Section 1433 of the SDWA; For cooperative agreements awarded under Section           
  1434 of the SDWA, FY 07 $0; FY 08 $20,119,149; and FY 09 est. $19,000,000            
  depending on funding available.                                                      
Range and Average of Financial Assistance:                                             
  For financial assistance awarded under Section 1433 of the SDWA, no funding          
  was provided in FY 07 and FY 08, and none is anticipated for FY 09; For              
  cooperative agreements awarded under Section 1434 of the SDWA, the range             
  was estimated as $3,000,000 to $12,000,000 per agreement. For Fiscal Year 08         
  the actual range was a low of $8,119,150 and a high of $11,999,999 for an            
  average of $10,059,574. Estimate for FY 09 is a low and high of $9,500,000 for       
  an average of $9,500,000.                                                            
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:                                                               
  Competitions are held at Headquarters and in the Regions based on available          
  funds and Agency priorities. The number of applications and the number of            
  awards made is dependent on the competitive announcement issued. The                 
  announcement will include the number of anticipated awards. In FY 07, for

  Section 1433 awards, no competitive announcements were issued and no new

  awards were made. Grantees with existing awards continued to provide direct

                                                                                       
  technical assistance to drinking water systems nationwide for the completion of      
  vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans. The immediate                
  outcome was that drinking water systems were able to address federal

                                                                                       
  requirements for the completion and submission of vulnerability assessments

                                                                                       
  and the creation or revision of emergency response plans. The long-term

                                                                                       
  outcome is that drinking water systems have improved their security through an       
  analysis of their vulnerabilities and preparation to address these vulnerabilities.  
  Currently for FY 08, EPA has no funds available; however, should funding             
  become available, projects that will improve the security of drinking water          
  systems will be the focus of the awards. For Section 1434 awards, this is a new      
  financial assistance pilot program. In FY 07, EPA issued a competitive               
  announcement (for FY 07 and FY 08 funds) to award up to four cooperative             
  agreements to support drinking water contamination warning system                    
  demonstration pilots. These pilots will be part of the Agency's Water Security       
  Initiative, which seeks to develop a warning system that achieves timely             
  detection of and appropriate response to drinking water contamination incidents.     
   It is anticipated that the pilots will include specified monitoring and             
  surveillance components, a consequence management plan, and an evaluation            
  plan. The anticipated outcome is that these pilots will generate information that    
  allows community water systems nationally to practice effective techniques to        
  detect and respond to possible contamination events. Drinking water consumers        
  will experience a reduction in risk associated with drinking water contamination     
  and improved water quality. In FY 08, cooperative agreements were awarded to         
  two pilots with the expectation that the project will demonstrate and review the



                                                                                  11-08
  effectiveness of drinking water contamination warning systems for community
  water systems, through reviewing multiple monitoring and surveillance
  components designed to provide timely detection of contamination in the
  drinking water distribution systems. In FY 2009 (using FY 08 and FY 09 funds)
  the Agency anticipates awarding the final two cooperative agreements for the
  pilot systems.

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  EPA has supported the following types of projects under financial assistance
  awarded under Section 1433 of the SDWA: 1. A private non-profit organization
  obtains training for approximately 120 of its members to become security
  trainers who will assist state and local agencies with drinking water security; 2.
  A private non-profit organization obtains training on the use of vulnerability
  assessment software and provides additional training for non-profit groups and
  state, tribal, and local agencies; 3. A private non-profit organization provides
  security training on the completion of vulnerability assessments and emergency
  response plans to drinking water systems serving populations between 50,000-
  100,000 people; 4. A private non-profit organization provides follow-up
  technical support to drinking water systems serving populations between
  50,000-100,000 people on the completion of vulnerability assessments and
  emergency response plans; and 5. A private non-profit organization provides
  direct technical assistance to drinking water systems nationwide serving
  populations between 3,300 and 10,000 people for the completion of
  vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans. For cooperative
  agreements to be awarded under Section 1434 of the SDWA, EPA anticipates
  funding contamination warning system demonstration pilots (i.e., designing,
  installing, and operating) that will include monitoring and surveillance
  components of the Water Security design, a consequence management plan, and
  an evaluation plan.

OBJECTIVES:
  To assist State and Tribal government agencies protect, manage, and restore
  wetlands. Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2008: This one-time pilot program
  funded FY 05 through FY07 funded assistance agreements for demonstration
  projects that proposed to demonstrate the extent to which the implementation of
  wetland programs (both regulatory and nonregulatory) resulted in positive
  environmental outcomes, in particular no net loss, net gain, and protection of
  vulnerable wetlands. The work plans contained at a minimum three basic
  elements: establishment of baseline data, implementation of wetland programs,
  and documentation of the environmental outcomes of the implementation of the
  wetland programs. This program was designed to be a one-time pilot effort; as a
  result, EPA does not plan on funding any new projects. Funding Priority - Fiscal
  Year 2009: This one-time pilot program, funded FY 05 through FY07, provided
  grants for states and tribes to implement regulatory and nonregulatory activities
  to assess whether financial assistance for wetland program implementation
  yields positive environmental outcomes. Grantees annually report the
