     with a concentration of substandard housing and very low and low-income              
     persons. In addition, the following criteria will be considered in the selection of  
     grant recipients. Each preapplication and its accompanying statement of              
     activities will be evaluated on: (1) The percentage of very low-income persons       
     assisted; (2) the percentage of use of HPG funds to total cost of housing            
     preservation; (3) the applicant's administrative capacity and experience in (i)      
     housing rehabilitation or weatherization, (ii) assisting very low and low-income     
     persons attain housing assistance and (iii) prior programs no outstanding audits     
     findings; (4) the proposed program will be undertaken in non-Metropolitan            
     Statistical Areas identified by Rural Development as having populations below        
     10,000 or in remote parts of other rural areas, (i.e., rural areas contained in      
     Metropolitan Statistical Areas with less than 5,000 population); (5) the program     
     will minimize the use of grant funds for administrative purposes, i.e., less than    
     20 percent of grant funds; (6) the program will alleviate overcrowding in rural      
     residences inhabited by very low and low-income families; and (7) if an existing     
     grantee has met the objectives of its current grant.

  estimated expenses for the fiscal year, the percentage allocation will be reduced
  so as to give all States the same percentage of their expenses. FSA views the use
