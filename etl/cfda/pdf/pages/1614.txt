Award Procedure:

  All applications are reviewed by a panel of nonfederal experts, which assigns      
  scores according to the published criteria. The panel's scores are factored into

  the recommendations for funding. Scores and recommendations are reviewed by        
  the Associate Commissioner of the Family and Youth Services Bureau, who            
  makes recommendations to the ACYF Commissioner, who makes the final                
  funding decisions.                                                                 
Deadlines:                                                                           
  As specified in the announcement or application instructions.                      
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:                                                  
  From 60 to 90 days.                                                                
Appeals:                                                                             
  None.                                                                              
Renewals:                                                                            
  Awards are made for 5-year project periods; funding after the first year is        
  dependent upon satisfactory performance, availability of funds and                 
  determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the          
  government.                                                                        
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                   
  Grantee must provide matching funds equal to at least 10 percent of the Federal    
  share. (There are certain exceptions for Tribes with "638" funding pursuant to     
  P.L. 93-638, under which certain Federal grants funds may qualify as matching      
  funds for other Federal grant programs, e.g., those which contribute to the        
  purposes for which grants under section 638 were made). The non-Federal share      
  may be met by cash or in-kind contributions, although applicants are encouraged    
  to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a five-    
  year project costing $1,000,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of             
  $200,000 per 12-month budget period) must include a match of at least              
  $100,000 ($20,000 per budget period).                                              
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                               
  Grants are awarded competitively for project periods of 5 years.                   
Reports:                                                                             
  Progress and Fiscal reports must be submitted semi-annually. A final program       
  and expenditure report must be submitted within 90 days after the completion of    
  the project period.                                                                
Audits:

  All financial records are to be maintained 3 years after termination of the project
  or until audit is completed, whichever occurs first.                               
Account Identification:
