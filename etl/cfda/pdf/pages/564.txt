  In fiscal year 2007, 94 Indian tribes/consortia are participating in the Tribal Self-
  Governance Program. The 94 annual funding agreements with Indian tribes and          
  tribal consortia will provide an estimated 234 Federally recognized Indian Tribes    
  with the opportunity to exercise discretion in establishing funding priorities, and  
  allow them wide latitude in the design of tribal programs, services, functions,      
  and activities in response to local circumstances.

  Among the activities supported by one consortium was the organization of a           
  tourism alliance, provision of 300 college scholarships, repair of 16 homes, and     
  the initiation of job readiness training for welfare recipients. A tribe in the      
  northwest managed over 3800 acres of forest land, helped 27 tribal members           
  move from welfare to paid employment, and supported 20 members in adult              
  education/training programs. Another tribal consortium provided life skills          
  assistance (tax preparation, driver's education, resume writing, etc.) to over 500   
  members, provided assistance to village groups in preparing economic                 
  development proposals which resulted in increased funding being provided by          
  other Federal agencies, and worked with the Reindeer Herders Association to          
  improve the health and economic value of the reindeer herds.
