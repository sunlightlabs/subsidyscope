  community policing and to purchase law enforcement equipment and                   
  technology. In addition to the above programs, funding for projects that advance   
  community policing, combat the proliferation of methamphetamine, increase the      
  use of interoperable technologies, combat gangs, combat firearms violence, build   
  faith based initiatives, and combat domestic violence have been awarded.
