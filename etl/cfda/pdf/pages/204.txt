  (a) To be eligible to receive cash payments, a dairy operation must: (1) Have     
  produced and marketed milk commercially in the United States anytime during       
  the fourth quarter of 1998; (2) Indicate all milk commercially marketed by all    
  persons in the dairy operation during calendar year 1997 and 1998 to establish

  hundredweight (cwt) used for payment; and (3) Apply for payments during the       
  application period. (b) A dairy operation must submit a timely application and

  DMLA-II as well as new dairy producers who began production in calendar year      
  2000. Under Pub. L. 108-324, payments will be made to producers who have          
  recently suffered dairy production and milk spoilage losses due to hurricanes in  
  2004.

  Form CCC 1040. The Form CCC 1040 should be submitted to the county FSA            
  office serving the county where the dairy operation is located. All persons who   
  share in the milk production of a dairy operation that marketed milk must certify 
  on the same CCC 1040 in order to obtain the total milk production of the dairy    
  operation before the application is complete.

Award Procedure:
  Payments under this subpart may be made to dairy operations only on the first
  26,000 cwt of milk produced by them from cows in the United States actually
  marketed in the United States during the base period. Supplemental payments
  under Public Law 106-387 will be made available to dairy operations in
  connection with normal milk production that is sold on the commercial market.
  For supplemental payments made under this section, the payment rate shall be
  $0.6468 per cwt. For dairy operations that received a payment under sections
  805 and 825 of Public Law 106-78 on less than 12 months production, an
  annual production level will be calculated by subtracting from the dairy
  operation's production level for the period of October 1, 1999 through
  September 30, 2000 the production level on which previous payments were
  received.
Deadlines:
  Applicants must apply for benefits during the sign-up period to be announced by
  the Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs. Eligible dairy producers can apply
  for program benefits anytime during this sign-up time frame. New
  announcements are posted on http://www.fsa.usda.gov/pas/.
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:
  From 1 to 60 days.
Appeals:
  Any producer who is dissatisfied with a determination may request
  reconsideration or appeal of such determination under part 11 or 780 of 7 CFR
  part 1430.
Renewals:
  Not applicable.
Formula and Matching Requirements:
  A payment rate will be determined after the conclusion of the application period,
  and shall be calculated by: (1) Converting whole pounds of milk to cwt; (2)
  Totaling the eligible cwt (not to exceed 26,000 cwt) of milk marketed
  commercially during the base period from all approved applications; and (3)
  Dividing the amount available for Dairy Market Loss Assistance Program by the
  total eligible cwt submitted and approved for payment. Each dairy operation
  payment will be calculated by multiplying the payment rate determined above by
  the dairy operation's eligible production. In the event that approval of all eligible
  applications would result in expenditures in excess of the amount available,
  CCC shall reduce the payment rate in such manner as CCC, in its sole
  discretion, finds fair and reasonable.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  Payments under this subpart may be made to dairy operations only on the first
  26,000 cwt of milk produced by them from cows in the United States actually
  marketed in the United States during the base period.
Reports:
  All persons involved in such dairy operation marketing milk during the fourth
  quarter of 1998 shall provide any available supporting documents to assist the
  county FSA office in verifying that the dairy operation produced and marketed
  milk commercially during the fourth quarter of 1998 and the base period milk
  marketings indicated on Form CCC 1040. Examples of supporting
  documentation include, but are not limited to: tank records, milk handler
  records, milk marketing payment stubs, daily milk marketings, copies of any
  payments received as compensation from other sources, or any other documents
  available to confirm the production and production history of the dairy
  operation. In the event that supporting documentation is not presented to the
  county FSA office requesting the information, dairy operations will be
  determined ineligible for benefits.
Audits:
  Recipients under this program are subject to audit by the Office of the Regional
  Inspector General, USDA.
Records:
  Producers approved for benefits under this program must maintain accurate
  records and accounts in order to document that they meet all eligibility

  Corporation or the Farm Service Agency. Such records and accounts must be
  retained for 3 years after the date of payment to the dairy operation under this
  program. Destruction of the records 3 years after the date of payment shall be
  the risk of the party undertaking the destruction.
