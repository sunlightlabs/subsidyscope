  In fiscal year 2003, the program supported six States in connecting to the Social    
  Security Administration's (SSA)on-line and batch verification system. Currently      
  42 States are using the SSA on-line and batch verification system. With States       
  instituting this check they were able to eliminate one potential means of            
  fraudulently obtaining a Commercial Drivers License. As of fiscal year 2007,         
  the program has helped jurisdictions meet substantial compliance with the Motor      
  Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999.
