  The standard application forms as furnished by the Federal agency and required       
  by OMB Circular No. A-102 and A-110 must be used for this program. EPA               
  requires final applications to be made on Standard Form 424. Applicants may be       
  able to use http://www.grants.gov to electronically apply for certain grant

  Competition in Assistance Agreements (9/12/02), Assistance awards to Foreign         
  Governments and to United Nations agencies and similar International                 
  Organizations, such as the Organization of American States and Organization          
  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) may be exempted from                 
  competition at the discretion of OIA. For competitive awards, Requests for           
  Initial Proposals or Requests for Applications will specify application              
  procedures.                                                                          
Award Procedure:                                                                       
  For competitive awards, EPA will review and evaluate applications, proposals,        
  and/or submissions in accordance with the terms, conditions, and criteria stated     
  in the competitive announcement. Competitions will be conducted in accordance        
  with EPA policies/regulations for competing assistance agreements. For non-          
  competitive awards, OIA will conduct an administrative evaluation to determine       
  the adequacy of the application in relation to grant regulations and to technical    
  and program evaluation to determine the merit and relevance of the project. The      
  Agency will then advise the applicant if funding is being considered. A final        
  work plan will then be negotiated with the applicant.                                
Deadlines:                                                                             
  For competitive awards, deadlines will be specified in Request for Applications      
  or Request for Initial Proposals.                                                    
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:                                                    
  Approximately 180 days.                                                              
Appeals:                                                                               
  Assistance agreement competition-related disputes will be resolved in                
  accordance with the dispute resolution procedures published in 70 FR (Federal        
  Register) 3629, 3630 (January 26, 2005). Copies of these procedures may also         
  be requested by contacting the individual(s) listed as "Information Contacts."       
  Disputes relating to matters other than the competitive selection of recipients      
  will be resolved under 40 CFR 30.63 or 40 CFR 31.70, as applicable.                  
Renewals:                                                                              
  None. A standard grant application should be prepared and submitted as a new         
  grant, which will be reviewed in the same manner as the original application and     
  will compete for available funds. Generally, EPA incrementally funds grants and      
  cooperative agreements. Approval of subsequent funding increments is                 
  dependent on satisfactory project progress, continued relevance of the project to    
  OIA's priorities, and availability of funds.                                         
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                     
  None.                                                                                
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                                 
  EPA normally funds grants and cooperative agreements on a 12-month basis.            
  However, EPA can negotiate the project period with each applicant based on           
  project requirements. EPA limits project periods to 5 years. Payments will be on     
  an advance letter of credit or reimbursement basis; recipient must request the       
  initial advance payment on SF 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement.             
Reports:                                                                               
  Reporting requirements are identified at 40 CFR Parts 30 and 31. EPA may             
  include additional information regarding the content and frequency of reporting      
  requirements in the terms and conditions of the agreements.                          
Audits:                                                                                
  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the       
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,       
  other EPA staff, or any authorized representative of the Federal government.         
  Reviews by the EPA Project Officer and the Grants Specialist may occur each          
  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,

  June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit                 
  Organizations," non-federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in

  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that

                                                                                       
  year. Non-federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal          
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted

  in OMB Circular No. A-133.

  The record retention requirements of 40 CFR Part 30 (non-profits and                 
  universities) or 40 CFR Part 31 (governmental units) are applicable depending        
  upon the identity of the recipient. Financial records, including all documents to    
  support entries on accounting records and to substantiate changes to each grant      
  must be kept available to personnel authorized to examine EPA grant accounts.        
  All records must be maintained until expiration of three years from the date of      


1042                                                                             11-08

  is completely resolved.
