  Corps of Engineers designs and constructs the project. Each project selected         
  must be engineering feasible, complete within itself, and economically justified.    
  The nonfederal sponsor must provide all lands, easements and rights-of-way;          
  provide all project costs in excess of the Federal limit of $500,000; agree to       
  maintain project after construction; hold and save the United States free from       
  damages; provide a contribution toward construction costs for land enhancement

  or special benefits; agree to prevent future encroachment which might interfere      
  with proper functioning of the project for flood control. Local cost participation   
  requirements and procedures for feasibility study cost-sharing and determining

  the local share of project cost are similar to those for flood control projects      
  specifically authorized by Congress under regular authorization procedures.
