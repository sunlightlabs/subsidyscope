  State has selected the program for review.
Application Procedure:
  Each State submits with its annual application a summary of estimated program
  costs by calendar year covering the State gas and/or hazardous liquid pipeline
  safety activities to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,
  DOT. This program is excluded from coverage under OMB Circular No. A-110.
Award Procedure:
  Awards are made by the Pipeline and Harardous Materials Safety
  Administration, DOT, Washington, DC.
Deadlines:
  Applications are submitted by September 30 for the next calendar year. A later
  date for filing applications is established if appropriations are not available by
  September 30.
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:
  From 60 to 90 days from date of receipt.
Appeals:
  Not applicable.
Renewals:
  Not applicable.
Formula and Matching Requirements:
  This program has no statutory formula. The Federal Pipeline Safety Law
  authorizes Federal reimbursement of up to 50 percent of a State's expenditure
  during the year for personnel, equipment, and activities reasonably required by
  the State agency for the conduct of its pipeline safety program. The Law further
  stipulates that the State expenditures in any given year, without Federal
  assistance, cannot be less than the average amount expended by the State for gas
  pipeline safety during fiscal years 1967 and 1968 and for the last 2 fiscal years
  preceding the date of enactment of the Pipeline Safety Acts. The State agency
  must also agree to provide the remaining cost of the safety program(s). Within
  these limitations, the available funds are allocated by a method designed to
  reflect the degree to which a State has met certain goals established. The
  allocation is determined by assigning point values to the States for having
  achieved certain levels of program participation, dividing this point score by the
  sum of the States' point scores, and multiplying this ratio by the amount
  available for the distribution. PHMSA distributed the remaining funds according
  to certain criteria designed to seek improvements in State programs. The criteria
  used by PHMSA were the extent of intrastate jurisdiction, inspector
  qualifications, recommended number of inspection person-days, State adoption
  of applicable Federal regulations, and other relevant criteria. In 2006, the Federal
  allocations represented 42 percent of the estimated State requests in the natural
  gas program (range: 37 to 43 percent) and the Federal allocations represented 42
  percent of the estimated State requests in the hazardous liquid program (range:
  34 to 43 percent).
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  Expenditures made by a State during the calendar year are eligible for Federal
  reimbursement. States receiving Federal assistance submit claims for
  reimbursement in July for the Federal share of the cost of actual expenditures
  between January 1 and June 30 of the year, and in January for Federal share of
  the cost of actual expenditures between July and December 31 of the year.
Reports:
  Annual activity reports.
Audits:
  In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A- 133 (Revised, June
  27, 2003), Audits of States, Local Governments, and Nonprofit Organizations,
  nonfederal entities that expend financial assistance of $500,000 or more in
  Federal awards will have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that
  year. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted
  in Circular No. A-133.
Records:
  All records relating to the program shall be retained for a period of not less than
  3 years from the date of submission of fund expenditure report.
Account Identification:
  69-5172-0-2-407.
Obligations:
  (Grants) FY 07 $19,518,000; FY 08 est $20,000,000; and FY 09 est not
  available.
Range and Average of Financial Assistance:
  $1,511 to $1,396,400.
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  Forty-nine State agencies requested and received allocations for fiscal year 2001
  for gas and/or liquid grant funds. No eligible State applicant was rejected. State
  agencies are increasing their knowledge and activities to help operators in their
  State in operating and maintaining safe pipeline systems.
