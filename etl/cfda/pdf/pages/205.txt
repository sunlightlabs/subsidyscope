  Eligible quota holder means only a person who, as of October 22, 2004, has           
  either a fee simple interest or life estate interest in the farm for which FSA       
  established a farm basic marketing quota for the 2004 marketing year. The

Beneficiary Eligibility:

  Eligible quota holder means only a person who, as of October 22, 2004, has           
  either a fee simple interest or life estate interest in the farm for which FSA       
  established a farm basic marketing quota for the 2004 marketing year. To be

  the farm for the 2002, 2003, or 2004 marketing years. For purposes of                
  determining if an eligible tobacco producer has shared in the risk of producing a    
  crop in the 2002, 2003, or 2004 crop years, CCC will consider evidence               
  presented by a producer that includes, but is not limited to: written leases;

Formula and Matching Requirements:
  Eligible tobacco quota holders will receive $7 per pound based upon their basic
  quota at the 2002 marketing year level. Producers of quota tobacco will receive
  up to $3 per pound payment based on their share of the risk in the 2002, 2003,
  and 2004 crops of quota tobacco. The annual payment will be calculated by
  multiplying the eligible producer's Base Quota Level (BQL) for each farm for
  crop years 2002, 2003, or 2004 by $0.10 per pound per year. For flue-cured and
  burley producers, the BQL will be equal to the 2002 effective quota produced on
  the farm. For tobacco other than flue-cured and burley, the producer's BQL will
  be equal to the 2002 basic allotment multiplied by the farm's 3-year average
  yield for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003.
