  nationwide and studies of employee benefits plans; (C) national and State data    
  on occupational injuries, illness and fatalities; and (D) information on work     
  stoppages. It also makes available funds in the form of cooperative agreements

  occupational injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. The Occupational Safety and     
  Health Statistics program authorizes funds on a matching basis to States or local 
  governments to assist them in developing and administering programs.

  program deliverables and costs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics awards
  cooperative agreement funding to the State or local government.
Deadlines:
  Cooperative agreements which cover a given Federal fiscal year are executed
  prior to the beginning of the fiscal year (October 1).

  mailed to State or local government in early summer, with initial drafts required
  by mid- summer, and final applications due by late summer. Cooperative
  agreements are executed by early-September and become effective October 1.
Appeals:
  None.
Renewals:
  Each fiscal year the Bureau of Labor Statistics enters into new cooperative
  agreements with appropriate State or local governments.

  The Federal share for each State's or local government's statistical program may
  be up to 50 percent of the State's or local government's total cost.

  Cooperative agreement funding generally is for a single fiscal year.
Reports:
  Cooperative agreements with State or local government specify quarterly
  financial reports and periodic program reports.
Audits:

  Federal Register June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and
  Non-Profit Organizations," nonfederal entities that expend financial assistance
  of $500,000 or more in Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific
  audit conducted for that year. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $500,000
  a year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that
  year, except as noted in Circular No. A-133.

  No. A-102 and No. A-110).

  resources required to operate the program. The range of awards in fiscal year
  2007 is from $4,100 (Idaho) to $630,900 (California). The average is $111,787.
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  In fiscal year 2007, the Office of Compensation Levels and Trends within the
  Office of Compensation and Working Conditions published approximately 138
  bulletins, news releases, and articles. Titles of these publications are included in
  the literature below. The National Compensation Survey (NCS) produces data
  on wages, salaries, and employee benefits from an integrated survey design.
  During 2007, the program completed transitioning to new industry and
  occupational classification systems and began using a new sample and revised
  definitions of metropolitan areas. The Occupational Safety and Health Statistics
  program produces data that allow for State publications, and provides tools for
  the States to conduct research and outreach. In 2007, the program continued to
  release data earlier in the year and produced nonfatal injury and illness rates for
  demographic characteristics for the first time. BLS provides establishments the
  option of responding to the Survey Occupational Injuries and Illnesses via the
  internet and now collects a significant portion of its annual data using this
  method.
