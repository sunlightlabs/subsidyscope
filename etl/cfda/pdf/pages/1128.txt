  The Long Island Sound Office (LISO) holds competitions throughout the year           
  based on available funds and Agency priorities. The number of applications and       
  the number of awards made is dependent on the announcement issued. The               
  announcement includes the number of anticipated awards. In FY 07, the                
  program reduced point source nitrogen loadings to Long Island Sound from             
  baseline level of 211,724 lbs/day to 153,932 lbs/day and reduced the areal extent    
  of the hypoxic event in Long Island Sound from 20 year average of 203 square         
  miles to 162 square miles; restored or protected 197 acres of coastal habitat;       
  reopened 22 river miles to anadromous fish passage. FY 2008 accomplishments          
  will not be available until October 2008. Three two-year competitive awards          
  were made in FY 07 totaling $400,000 and averaging $66,666 per year. In FY           
  08 six awards were made totaling $4,489,134 averaging $748,189.

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  Grants and cooperative agreements awarded to states and local governments,
  colleges, universities, interstate agencies and nonprofit organizations are for
  nonpoint source implementation, scientific research, water quality monitoring
  and modeling, public education and outreach, living resources management,
  habitat restoration and program support. Examples are listed as follows: (1)
  Hypoxia: sustain and accelerate efforts to meet the LISS nutrient reduction goals
  in the nitrogen Total Maximum Daily Load to attain water quality conditions
  necessary to support the living resources of the Sound; (2) Habitat Restoration:
  restore and protect living resources, their habitats and ecological relationships;
  (3) Water Quality Monitoring: collect water quality samples at monitoring
  stations in Long Island Sound and interpret data on Long Island Sound and
  embayments. (4) Communication/Outreach: Provide communication, outreach
  and education components of the LISS partnership; (5) Modeling: develop,
  calibrate, and manage the application of linked airshed-watershed-estuarine
  hydrodynamic-water quality-living resources models to support the LISS for
  understanding the nutrient and sediment affects in the Long Island Sound
  estuary system and (6) Research: investigate causes and effects of eutrophication
  on water quality and living marine resources; study factors affecting abundance
  and distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation, food web dynamics, and tidal
  wetland loss.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
  The evaluation and selection criteria for competitive awards under this CFDA
  description will be described in the competitive announcement.
66.439 TARGETED WATERSHEDS GRANTS
FEDERAL AGENCY:
  OFFICE OF WATER, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
AUTHORIZATION:
  Consolidated Appropriations 2005, Public Law 108-447; Dept. of Interior,
  Environmental and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006, Public Law
  109-54. Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution 2007, H.J. Res. 20
  Public Law 110-5.
OBJECTIVES:
  To support innovative, community-based watershed approaches aimed at
  preventing, reducing, or eliminating water pollution. The Targeted Watersheds
  Grant Program provides resources in the form of grants or cooperative
  agreements to support watershed organizations in their efforts to expand and
  improve existing water protection measures. In separate competitive
  announcements funds are awarded to assist watershed partnerships comprised of
  State, Tribal, local, and interstate agencies, and public or nonprofit organizations
  in developing, implementing, and demonstrating: 1) on-the-ground projects to
  improve or maintain water quality; and 2) organizational and technical capacity
  building projects to prime organizations to be in a position to implement on-the-
  ground watershed projects. Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2008: To build upon
  the existing activities of watershed organizations to support innovative, wide-
  reaching plans to restore, preserve, or protect the nation's waters. The
  cornerstone of the implementation portion of the program is diverse partnerships
  that are ready to implement projects to improve water quality and produce
  tangible, measurable, environmental results in a short time frame.
  Approximately $4 million will be set aside to focus on trading projects in the
  Mississippi River Basin that will potentially reduce the size and duration of the
  hypoxic zone in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Finally, approximately $10
  million will be set aside for the Western Estuaries Initiative that will support
  projects that conserve, restore and protect water quality, habitat and environment
  of western coastal waters, estuaries, surrounding basins, bays and near shore
  waters through comprehensive approaches to water quality management.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Project Grants (Cooperative Agreements).
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  Funds are used to support both on-the-ground and educational activities relating
  to the prevention, reduction, and elimination of water pollution. Funds are
  awarded to eligible entities that best meet the selection criteria described in the
  Request for Proposals. Successful candidates will have a thorough knowledge of
  their watershed, have a watershed management plan in place, propose a specific
  project to address identified problems or barriers to water quality, demonstrate
  broad-based support from a number of public and private entities, and have a
                                                                                     941
