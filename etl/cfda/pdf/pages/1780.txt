  In fiscal year 2004, an average of 7,696,000 disabled workers and their             
  dependents received monthly cash benefits. It is estimated that for fiscal year     
  2005, an average of 8,005,000 disabled workers and their dependents will            
  receive monthly cash benefits. During fiscal year 2006, the average number

  eligible worker age 62 or over receives benefits before full-benefit retirement age

                                                                                      
  (FRA)(age 66 for workers age 62 in 2005), the individual's retirement benefit       
  will be permanently reduced. Also, certain family members can receive benefits      
  including: (1) A wife or husband age 62 or over; (2) a spouse at any age, if a      
  child who is under age 16 or is disabled is in his or her care and is entitled to   
  benefits based on the worker's record; (3) unmarried children under age 18 (or      
  under age 19 for students in elementary or secondary school); (4) unmarried         
  adult offspring at any age if disabled before age 22; and (5) divorced wives or     
  husbands age 62 or over who were married to the worker for at least 10 years.       
  Beginning January 1985, spouses ages 62 or over who have been divorced for at       
  least 2 years (and married to the worker for at least 10 years) may become          
  entitled to benefits regardless of whether the former spouse who is at least age 62 
  and fully insured has applied for benefits. Effective January 1991, the 2-year      
  waiting period for payment of divorced spouse's benefits without regard to the      
  former spouse's earnings was waived if the former spouse was entitled to            
  benefits prior to the divorce. All benefits, other than benefits to disabled        
  beneficiaries, and beneficiaries FRA and older, are subject to an earnings test.    
  Beginning with the year 2000, the retirement earnings test was eliminated           
  beginning with the month in which the beneficiary reaches FRA. A person at          
  and above FRA will not have Social Security benefits reduced because of             
  earnings. In the calendar year in which a beneficiary reaches FRA, benefits are     
  reduced $1 for every $3 of earnings above the limit allowed by law, $31,800 in      
  2005, but this reduction is applied only to months prior to attainment of FRA.      
  For years before the year the beneficiary attains FRA, the reduction in benefits is 
  $1 for every $2 of earnings over the annual exempt amount, $11,640 in 2005.         


                                                                                11-08 
  For workers who are first eligible after 1985 for both (a) a pension based on non-
  covered employment; and (b) Social Security retirement (or disability) benefits,
  a different benefit formula applies which provides somewhat lower benefits.
  The Social Security benefit for a spouse of a retired worker is subject to a
  pension offset if the spouse receives a governmental pension based on his or her
  own work in non-covered employment. However, the offset does not apply if: (i)
  the person has received or became eligible to receive the pension before
  December 1, 1982, and met eligibility requirements for Social Security
  auxiliaries' benefits as they existed in January 1977; or (ii) if the person receives,
  or is eligible to receive, the pension before July 1, 1983, and the person was
  dependent on his or her spouse for at least one-half support at the time the
  spouse died, became disabled or became entitled to Social Security benefits.
  The amount of the public pension used for purposes of the offset against Social
  Security spouse's benefits is equal to two-thirds of the public pension. The
  benefit for the spouse of a retired worker is also offset dollar for dollar by the
  amount of any Social Security benefit the spouse receives based on his or her
  own work. Effective for those who have reached age 62 since August 1981, a
  retired worker or spouse can receive benefits only for months in which he or she
  has attained at least age 62 for the entire month. No benefit can be paid to an
  alien in the United States unless he or she is lawfully present in the United
  States. In addition, an alien cannot qualify for benefits if he or she never had a
  work-authorized
  SocialSeurity Number (SSN) effective for benefit applications based on SSNs
  issued after 2003).
Beneficiary Eligibility:
