  This program is eligible for coverage under E.O. 12372, Intergovernmental           
  Review of Federal Programs. An applicant should consult the office or official      
  designated as the single point of contact in his or her State for more information  
  on the process the State requires to be followed in applying for assistance, if the 
  State has selected the program for review.                                          
Application Procedure:                                                                
  Funding opportunity announcements for this program, along with registration         
  procedures, application packages and instructions, SF-424 forms and any other       
  forms to be used to submit application information, points of contact, and          
  procedures for submitting applications will be available on www.grants.gov.         
Award Procedure:                                                                      
  Reclamation will solicit proposals and award funding through a Request for          
  Application (RFA) process. The RFA will request proposals from public and           
  private sectors that would control salinity based on cost per ton. The proposals    
  will be ranked based on their cost effectiveness for preventing salt from entering  
  the Colorado River system. The ranking would consider risk factors that might       
  affect the project's performance. Upon receipt of applications/proposals by the     
  date identified in the announcement(s), the applications will be reviewed to        
  determine if application/proposal(s) are consistent with requirements identified    
  in the announcements. The application/proposal(s) are reviewed against              
  identified criteria by a Federal technical team of experts, that may include        
  representatives of states as advisors. Based on the review, a ranking will be       
  defined. Negotiations will be conducted and/or awards will be made based on         
  recommendations from the technical experts. Award will be based on those            
  applications best meeting the needs of the program, including cost and risk         
  factors.

RELATED PROGRAMS:
  10.070, Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program.
EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  Salinity Improvement Project; Identifying Sources of Salt and Water in Grand
  Valley, CO; Eden Valley Salinity Project.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
  In 1984, the Salinity Control Act was amended to direct the Secretary of the
  Interior to give preference to units which reduce salinity at the least cost per unit
  of salinity reduction (or cost-effectiveness). Cost-effectiveness is defined as the
  Salinity Program's annual cost per ton of salt prevented from entering the
  Colorado River system. Conceptually, cost-effectiveness is analogous to
  determining the cost per mile to own and operate a car. That computation
  combines the annual expenses (loan payments, gas, maintenance, etc.) and
  divides by the miles traveled each year. The key to understanding this approach
  is to appreciate that the government evaluates all projects as if the money is
  borrowed from a loan institution and repaid in annual installments over the life
  of the project. This economic evaluation principle is required by the "Economic
  and Environmental Principles Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources
  Implementation Studies", March 1983. This method lends consistency in the
  comparison of non-federally financed alternatives (which must borrow funds) to
  Federally financed projects. Each proposal will be evaluated by a technical
  review panel in accordance with the following criteria and corresponding
  percentage weights: (a) Technical merit - those passing will be evaluated
  further, (b) Cost effectiveness 70 percent of the annual cost for each ton of salt
  load reduction, expressed in dollars per ton, (c) Performance risk 30 percent of
  performance risk will evaluate the cost and effectiveness risks of the proposal.
  More detailed information will be included in each funding announcement or
  may be obtained from the Salinity Control Program contacts listed above.
