  The review process for grants/cooperative agreements consists of initially          
  screening applications for completeness and relevancy to CMS priority areas. If     
  the application is not relevant to CMS priority areas, it will be returned to the   
  applicant. If accepted as submitted it will be reviewed and evaluated. The review   
  will be conducted by a panel of not less than three experts. CMS Project Officer    
  will coordinate the panel's review, but will not vote. This individual will also    
  prepare the panel's recommendation to the Director, Office of Research,             
  Development, and Information (ORDI). The panel's recommendations will               
  contain numerical ratings, rankings of applications, and a written assessment of    
  each application. The recommendations will be based on published criteria as        
  stated in the Federal Register. The review process for applications is also stated  
  in the Federal Register Announcement.

  relation to losses incurred in the fiscal year 2002, 2003, and 2004. A State can
  be awarded a maximum of two grants. As directed by the statute, funds will be
  allocated using a formula based on the number of uninsured individuals in each
  eligible State. The formula was further defined through the rulemaking process
  with a regulation with a 60-day comment period. See the website:
  www.cms.hhs.gov/riskpool for additional information.
