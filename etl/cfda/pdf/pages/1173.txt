  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the     
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,     
  other EPA staff, or any authorized representative of the Federal government.       
  Reviews by the EPA Project Officer and the Grants Specialist may occur each        
  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,        
  June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit               
  Organizations," non-federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in     
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that  
  year. Non-federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal        
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted   
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.

  The record retention requirements of 40 CFR Part 30 are applicable. Financial      
  records, including all documents to support entries on accounting records and to   
  substantiate charges to each grant, must be kept available to personnel            
  authorized to examine EPA grant accounts. All records must be maintained until     
  three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report. If        
  questions still remain, such as those raised as a result of audit, related records 
  should be retained until the matter is completely resolved.

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:                                                         
  (1) Propose a unique approach to blend green and animal wastes into a product      
  that will be a nutrient-rich soil amendment and/or fuel source. This product       
  represents a new approach toward waste use that combines two problem wastes        
  to form a usable product. (2) Develop a novel solid acid catalyst (NSAC) for the   
  esterification of fatty acids to remove them from feedstocks that would be         
  utilized in biodiesel production. The removal of these fatty acids would make      
  the processing of waste oil feedstock less difficult, helping minimize the         
  costliness of biofuels. (3) A novel scrubber will be designed for the selective    
  capture of trace elements such as mercury, selenium, and arsenic from the flue     
  gases of coal combustion. The novel sorbent material will prevent trace element    
  contamination in flue gas desulfurization (FGD) byproducts and thereby permit      
  safer handling and recycling of the products, making coal combustion more          
  sustainable. (4) Use virgin plant oils, animal fats and waste cooking oil as       
  sustainable resources that can reduce the use of petroleum derived fuels.          
  (5)Design and demonstrate a sustainable point-of-use water treatment facility      
  consisting of biosand filtration and UV sterilization systems. See Web Page        
  (http://es.epa.gov/ncer/p3/past/index.html) for additional information on
