16.309 LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE-NATIONAL
INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM
   (NICS)
FEDERAL AGENCY:
  FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
AUTHORIZATION:
  Gun Control Act, 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44, Public Law 103-159; National Firearms
  Act, 26 U.S.C. Chapter 53.
OBJECTIVES:
  To provide a system so that any Federal Firearm Licensee (FFL) could gain
  information, by telephone or by other electronic means, on whether receipt of a
  firearm by a prospective buyer would violate Federal or State laws through the
  proper completion of Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Fireams (ATF) Form
  4473.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Provision of Specialized Services.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  The NICS Operations Center conducts NICS background checks by analyzing
  and evaluating criminal history records to determine whether the transfer of a
  firearm to an individual may violate State or Federal law. The staff at the
  Operations Center provides technical and operational support to users, provides
  customer service to FFLs and State Point of Contacts (POCs), processes appeals
  of denied transactions, and prepares management and statistical reports on the
  operation of the NICS.
Applicant Eligibility:
  All persons purchasing firearms.
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  The Federal Firearm Licensees and American public.
Credentials/Documentation:
  Initial request for services must be from a licensed and enrolled FFL. For checks
  performed by the FBI, FFLs may contact the NICS Operation Center by
  telephone via a toll- free number or, in the future, electronically by computer. If
  a NICS background check results in no matching records, the transfer will be
  allowed, and the FFL will be provided with a unique NICS Transaction Number
  (NTN). If one or more matching records are found, an FBI examiner will review
  the record(s) to determine if the subject of the record may be identical with the
  prospective purchaser and to determine if the record contains information which
  may prohibit the sale of the firearm. If so, the transfer will be denied, and the
  prospective buyer will be advised of the process for appealing the decision if
  he/she believes it is incorrect. The FBI may contact local, State, and Federal law
  enforcement agencies and courts to resolve questions about an individual who
  appears to be prohibited from purchasing a firearm, as well as to request
