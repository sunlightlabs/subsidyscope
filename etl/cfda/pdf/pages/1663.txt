  private organizations to prevent incidents of family violence and to provide       
  immediate shelter and related assistance to victims of family violence. States     
  must give special emphasis to the support of community-based projects of           
  demonstrated effectiveness carried out by nonprofit private organizations,         
  particularly those projects where the primary purpose is to operate shelters for   
  victims of family violence, and those which provide counseling, advocacy, and      
  self-help services to victims and their children. States and Indian Tribes may not 
  impose an income eligibility standard on individuals receiving services            
  supported by funds appropriated under this Act and Federal funds may not be        
  used as direct payment to any victim of family violence. No less than 70 percent   
  of the funds distributed must be used for immediate shelter and related            
  assistance, and no less than 25 percent for related assistance.
