EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  Reimbursement of Travel and Subsistence Expenses toward Living Organ
  Donation: The funded project will establish and operate a National system to
  provide reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses to individuals making
  living donations of their organs. Clinical Interventions to Increase Organ
  Procurement Grant Program: Funded projects include such interventions such as
  pulsatile perfusion of kidneys, pulsatile perfusion in the expanded kidney donor,
  chest wall oscillation to improve quantity and quality of brain dead heart beating
  donor lungs and validation of identification criteria for DCD donors. FY 2007
  awards will be focused on uncontrolled donation after cardiac death (UDCD).
  Social and Behavioral Interventions to Increase Organ Donation Grant Program:
  Funded projects include social and behavioral interventions to promote
  awareness of the need for donors and commitment to organ donation through the
  workplace, in schools, and on Native American Indian reservations, and projects
  to increase the number of dialysis patients who are aware of their option to
  identify a living donor. State Donor Registry Support Program: The funded
  project will develop and launch a statewide registry in Kentucky in which
  residents can indicate their intent to be organ, tissue, and eye donors. Grants to
  Establish Programs Coordinating Organ Donation activities of Hospitals and
  Organ Procurement Organizations: The funded projects provide for the
  availability of trauma and acute hospital's to support in-house organ donation
  program coordinators to increase or maintain an organ donation conversion rate
  of 75 percent through improved identification and referral of potential donors,
  improved effective requesting, especially to improve minority conversion rates
  and to implement donation following cardiac death, resulting in increased
  numbers of transplantable organs from single donors. These project goals are
  consistent with the IHI Donation Breakthrough Collaborative and awardees will
  provide both quantitative and qualitative data at the end of the project period.
