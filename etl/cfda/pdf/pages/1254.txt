  NICE3 met its original goals to save energy, improve the environment, and          
  provide an economic boost to U.S. industry . NICE3 originated in 1991 as a U.      
  S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)            
  joint initiative to promote Global competitiveness of U.S. industries through the  
  development and commercialization of energy-efficient goods, produced with         
  state-of-the-art energy-efficient production technologies and practices. It has    
  resulted in the commercialization of 32 technologies of which 27 are still on the  
  market today. These commercial technologies have resulted in a cumulative          
  U.S. energy savings of 34.5 trillion Btu. In 2000 the 27 NICE3 technologies still  
  in the marketplace saved 10.6 trillion Btu.
