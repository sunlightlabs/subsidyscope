  Applications for the Resource-related Research Projects (R24) and Cooperative      
  Agremment applications ("U" applications) must be prepared using the PHS 398       
  research grant application instructions and forms (Revised 9/2004 with an          
  update on 4/2006). The PHS 398 is available at                                     
  http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.html in an interactive         
  format. Consultation on a proposed project may be obtained from the NIMH           
  branch or office responsible for the research area of interest. Applications are   
  reviewed by principally nonfederal consultants recruited nationwide from the       
  mental health field. The amounts of the award and period of support are            
  determined on the basis of merit of the project and the nature of the grant        
  mechanism. Electronic applications are submitted through the Grants.gov            
  website. Completed PHS 398 applications should be submitted to the National        
  Institutes of Health, Center for Scientific Review, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room     
  1040 - MSC 7710, Bethesda, MD 20892-7710 or Bethesda, MD 20817 (for                
  express/courier service). This program is subject to the provisions of 45 CFR,     
  Part 92 for State and local governments, OMB Circular No. A-110 for nonprofit      
  organizations, cost principles of A-21 for educational institutions, and 42 CFR,   
  Part 42.

  All applications for research grants, cooperative agreements, SBIR and STTR        
  grants are evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate          
  scientific peer review panel and by the National Advisory Mental Health            
  Council (excepting Small Grants). All competitive applications compete for         
  available funds on the basis of scientific and technical merit, program relevance, 
  and program balance. All SBIR and STTR applications receiving a priority score     
  compete for set-aside funds on the basis of scientific and technical merit and     
  commercial potential of the proposed research, program relevance, and program      
  balance among the areas of research.

  HHS grant. For-profit organizations have two options regarding the type of audit
  that will satisfy the audit requirements either: (1) a financial related audit (as
  defined in the Government Auditing Standards, GPO Stock #020-000-00-265-4,
  http://www.gao.gov/govaud/ybk01.htm) of the HHS awards in accordance with
