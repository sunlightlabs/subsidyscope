  Provides for Consumer Price Indexes (CPI) which measure changes in prices of       
  goods and services consumed by all urban households as well as urban wage          
  earners and clerical workers. As the basis for most estimates of changes in the    
  purchasing power of the consumer's dollar, the CPI is a major economic             
  indicator and has widespread use in escalation adjustments in both private and     
  public sectors. Provides for Producer Price Indexes (PPI) which measure            
  average changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output  
  and which are widely cited within price escalation clauses of long term sales

  contracts to protect both parties against inflation. Provides Export and Import

  Price Indexes to measure the effect of international trade prices on U.S.          
  economy. The Consumer Expenditure (CE) Surveys provide periodic updates to         
  the market basket and the weights used to calculate the CPI. In addition, the CE   
  supplies information on consumers' spending and income by characteristics such     
  as income, age, race, family size, and region.

PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  In fiscal year 2008, the Consumer Price Indexes (CPI), Producer Price Indexes
  (PPI), International Price Indexes (IPP), and Consumer Expenditure Surveys
  (CE) continue, as will regular publication of data from these price statistics
  programs. During 2008, the CPI program will continue publication of the new
  superlative measure of changes in living costs. The new measure more fully
  reflects the impact of changes in relative prices on consumers. IPP will have
  offered its new web-based repricing collection to 95 percent of its respondents
  by the end of 2008. PPI expanded its coverage of the service sector to include
  management consulting, blood banks, computer training schools, and industrial
  machinery equipment and repair. PPI completed a major quality improvement
  initiative to implement a probability-based methodology for prescription drugs.
  Coverage in the PPI also expanded with the publication of the new office
  construction index. In 2008, the CE added questions about the new tax rebate
  and began collecting the data, revised and tested changes to the upcoming 2009
  Interview questionnaire.
