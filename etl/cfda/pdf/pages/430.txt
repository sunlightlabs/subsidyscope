  PSIC funds were allocated using a two-part process. First, each State, the          
  District of Columbia and Puerto Rico will receive a minimum of $3 million and       
  each Territory will receive a minimum of $500,000 to ensure that it will be able    
  to make meaningful improvements to its interoperable communications                 
  capabilities. The remaining 80 percent of funds are allocated to States and         
  Territories using a formula similar to the current Homeland Security Grant          
  Program (HSGP) risk formula, this formula is the product of three variables:        
  threat, vulnerability and consequence.
