PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:                                                            
  Through FY 2007, a total of 50 entities (49 States and the District of Columbia)  
  have been approved for funding from the Infrastructure Grant Program section      
  203 since its inception. There are 33 States with Medicaid buy-ins and one        
  additional State has a plan amendment under review. As of September 30, 2006,     
  there were just over 78,402 workers receiving Medicaid benefits under the buy-    
  in options. A total of 26 States and the District of Columbia have applied for    
  and will receive continuation grant awards in FY 2007. Nine States received new   
  competitive grant awards in FY 2006. In addition, five States, South Carolina,    
  Missouri, Iowa, Indiana and Arkansas will continue to carry out employment        
  goals for the working disabled population by spending previous grant awards in    
  FY 2007 through a no-cost extension of funding. Of the $42.8 million (FY          
  2007) that has been appropriated for the upcoming grant year, $34.7 million was   
  granted to the States. The reason for the large discrepancy in the FY 2007        
  appropriation, and the funding amount is that States are enrolling fewer          
  participants in Medicaid buy-in programs than Congress originally anticipated.    
  Higher levels of funding are legislatively related to the yearly amount of        
  Medicaid buy-in service costs expended by a State.

  The major elements in evaluating proposals include: understanding the barriers    
  that impede competitive employment of people with disabilities; the extent to     
  which the proposed infrastructure development will offer enduring and             
  significant improvement in the ability of the system to provide adequate health   
  coverage for people with disabilities and are competitively employed; providing   
  needed personal assistance and other supports, and/or removing other significant  
  employment barriers; the appropriateness of the methods, work plan, budget,       
  and timetable; the qualifications of key staff; and the State's plan for using its
  grant experiences to identify different or better ways to improve its buy-in or   
  Medicaid services that support the competitive employment efforts of people       
  with disabilities.
