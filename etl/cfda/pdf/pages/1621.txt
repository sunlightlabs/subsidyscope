  Applications are initially screened for relevance to program interests of the       
  Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE). Ineligible applications will be         
  returned to the applicant. Eligible applications are reviewed and evaluated by a    
  review panel of not less than three knowledgeable people. A limited number of       
  projects may be approved pending available funds and will compete with other        
  nonpriority projects. Written assessment of each application is made. This          
  program is excluded from coverage under E.O. 12372.

  Official notice of approved grant applications is made through issuance of a        
  Notice of Grant Award. This provides the amount of funds awarded, the purpose       
  of the award, the term and conditions of the award, the budget period for which     
  support is given, the total project period for which support is contemplated, and   
  the total grantee participation.

  to State IV-D directors. Unsolicited applications may be submitted at any time.

  There are no formal appeals procedures. If an application for a grant is            
  disapproved,applicants may request the reasons for disapproval. In the case of      
  unsolicited proposals, applicants are free to resubmit applications with attention  
  to the changes suggested by the reasons for disapproval.

  Extensions and continuations of grants with 1-year project periods are generally    
  not available except under extreme circumstances. If an application is              
  recommended for approval for 2 or more years, the grantee must submit a formal      
  request for continuation each year accompanied by a progress report which will      
  be evaluated prior to a recommendation of continuation. This is not applicable to   
  contracts.

  beyond the first year is contingent upon acceptable evidence of satisfactory        
  progress and availability of funds.

  audit requirements for that year except as noted in Circular No. A-133.             
Records:
