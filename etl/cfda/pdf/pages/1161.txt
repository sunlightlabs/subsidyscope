EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  (1) Develop a direct health indicator of pediatric asthma morbidity resulting
  from exposure to ambient air pollutants using an epidemiological approach that
  merges existing datasets and incorporates population susceptibility and exposure
  patterns. (2) Evaluate the secondary organic aerosol forming potential of classes
  of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). (3) Investigate the effect of climate
  change, expressed as drought induced stressors, on key ecological processes and
  functions within tidal salt marshes and ecosystem services that are derived from
  these processes and functions. (4) Concentrate and detect waterborne pathogens
  at low levels by a series of complementary and non-destructive techniques. (5)
  Characterize the spatial variability of coarse particles from natural and
  anthropogenic sources and examine their associations with cardiovascular and
  respiratory disease. See Web Page (http://www.epa.gov/ncer) for additional
  information on previously funded grants under the STAR program.
