  1981, must also have served at least 24 months of continuous active duty or the    
  full period for which the person was called or ordered to active duty. Veterans of

  compensable service-connected disability or were discharged after at least 181     
  days (90 days during Persian Gulf War), under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1171

  medical conditions, or in some instances, for the convenience of the               
  Government; (d) unmarried surviving spouses of otherwise eligible veterans who     
  died in service or whose deaths were attributable to service-connected
