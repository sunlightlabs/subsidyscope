  program goals and the applicant's participation in the national administration of
  the program are all taken into consideration. Additional considerations include

  Review of Federal Programs." An applicant should consult the office or official
  designated as the single point of contact in their State for more information on
  the process the State requires to be followed in applying for assistance. The
  standard application forms (SF-424) as furnished by the Federal agency in
  accordance with 28CFR, Part 66 must be used with this program.
Application Procedure:
  Applications are submitted on-line through the Office of Justice Programs Grant
  Management System at: https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/ and must follow the criteria
  outlined in the solicitation as well as the JAG Program Guidance Manual.
Award Procedure:
  A letter with copies of the grant award are sent to the applicant agency upon
  approval by the Bureau of Justice Assistance. One copy of the grant award must
  be signed by the authorized official and returned to the Office of Justice
  Programs.
Deadlines:
  Applications must be submitted within 90 days of the signing of the
  Appropriation by the President, or as otherwise specified by the Bureau of

Formula and Matching Requirements:

  violent crime statistics, and a direct allocation to units of local government.
  Once the State allocation is calculated, 60 percent of the funding is awarded to
  the State and 40 percent to the eligible units of local government. State
  allocations also have a required "variable pass through to units of local
  governments, as calculated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) from each
  State's crime expenditures. There is no match required at the Federal level.
  However matching is an effective strategy for states and local units of
  government to expand justice funds and build buy-in for local criminal justice
  initiatives.
