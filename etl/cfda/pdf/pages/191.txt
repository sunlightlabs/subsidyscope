  Loans and loan deficiency payments (LDP's) give farmers a means of promoting        
  more orderly marketing. Loans to producers may be "nonrecourse" which means         
  that producers have the option of forfeiting the collateral to CCC at loan          
  maturity in full satisfaction of the loan obligation; or "recourse" for low quality 
                                                                                      
  grain, or un-ginned seed cotton, which means that producers must repay the

                                                                                      
  loans by maturity." If market prices are above the support level producers may

                                                                                      
  repay their loans at the original loan principal plus interest and market their

                                                                                      
  commodities. When market prices are low, most nonrecourse commodity loan

                                                                                      
  repayments are less than the original loan principal plus interest. Eligible

                                                                                      
  commodities for loans are feed grains, wheat, rice, peanuts, tobacco, upland

                                                                                      
  cotton, extra-long staple cotton, sugar, soybeans, crambe, canola, flaxseed,

                                                                                      
  mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower, and sunflower seed. LDP's are offered for

                                                                                      
  feed grains, wheat, upland cotton, rice, soybeans, crambe, canola, flaxseed,

                                                                                      
  mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower, and sunflower seed. If the loan repayment

                                                                                      
  rates for these commodities are less than the established loan levels, producers

                                                                                      
  may, for most commodities that are eligible for a nonrecourse loan, agree to

                                                                                      
  forego such loan and elect to receive an LDP. The LDP payment rate equals the       
  amount by which the loan rate exceeds the loan repayment rate in effect at the      
  time the LDP application is approved, or the delivery date for commodities          
  delivered directly to processor, buyer, or warehouse from the field. LDP's and      
  any gain realized from repaying a loan at a level lower than the original loan      
  level are subject to a $75,000 per "person" payment limitation, except for crops    
  produced in 1999, for which the payment limitation is $150,000 per "person".
