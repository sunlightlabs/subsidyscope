  In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133, "Audits of

  States, Local Governments, and Nonprofit Organizations," nonfederal entities        
  that expend $500,000 or more in its fiscal year in Federal awards shall have a      
  single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the

  provisions of this circular. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $500,000 a   
  year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year,    
  except as noted in Circular No. A-133. In addition, grants and cooperative          
  agreements are subject to inspection and audits by DHHS and other Federal           
  government officials. Per the regulations, a for-profit (commercial) organization   
  is subject to audit requirements for a non-Federal audit if, during its fiscal year,
  it expended $500,000 or more under HHS awards and at least one award is a           
  HHS grant. For-profit organizations have two options regarding the type of audit    
  that will satisfy the audit requirements either: 1. a financial related audit (as   
  defined in the Government Auditing Standards, GPO Stock #020-000-00-265-4,          
  http://www.gao.gov/govaud/ybk01.htm) of the HHS awards in accordance with           
  Government Auditing Standards, or 2. an audit that meets the requirements           
  contained in OMB Circular No. A-

  Records must be retained at least 3 years; records shall be retained beyond the 3-
