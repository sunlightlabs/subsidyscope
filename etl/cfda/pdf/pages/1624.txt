  taking into account the amount of leveraging carried out by all grantees.

  $247,769,199 to $ 2,113,267.
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

OBJECTIVES:
  To provide assistance to States and local communities, working through a
  network of community action agencies and other neighborhood-based
  organizations, for the reduction of poverty, the revitalization of low-income
  communities, and the empowerment of low-income families and individuals in
  rural and urban areas to become fully self-sufficient (particularly families who
  are attempting to transition off a State program carried out under part A of title
  IV of the Social Security Act) and (1) To provide services and activities having a
  measurable and potential major impact on causes of poverty in the community or
  those areas of the community where poverty is a particularly acute problem; (2)
  to provide activities designed to assist low-income participants, including the
  elderly poor, to: (a) secure and retain meaningful employment; (b) attain an
  adequate education; (c) make better use of available income; (d) obtain and
  maintain adequate housing and a suitable living environment; (e) obtain
  emergency assistance through loans or grants to meet immediate and urgent
  individual and family needs, including health services, nutritious food, housing,
  and employment-related assistance; (f) remove obstacles and solve problems
  which block the achievement of self-sufficiency; (g) achieve greater
  participation in the affairs of the community; and (h) make more effective use of
  other related programs; (3) to provide on an emergency basis for the provision of
  such supplies and services, nutritious foodstuffs, and related services, as may be

  low-income individuals.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:

  entities" as defined in the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) Act, as

  for administrative expenses at the State level.
