  rural areas, in medically underserved areas, in frontier communities, and           
  medically underserved populations. The regional telehealth resource centers         
  must support the activities of existing or developing telehealth networks in their  
  regions to meet the health care needs of rural or other populations to be served,   
  including the improvement of access to services and the quality of the services     
  received by those populations. Regional TRCs have expertise in at least four (4)    
  of the following areas: Clinical Outpatient Specialty Care; Critical or Emergency   
  Care; Residential telehealth (home care)/chronic disease management; Nursing        
  Home/Inpatient Care; Distance Education and Training; Store-and-Forward;

  projects are to build on the first year of efforts to develop national models for   
  addressing barriers to adoption of the Nurse Licensure Compact and implement        
  model agreements to expedite the licensure process and eliminate redundancies       
  associated with applying for physician licenses in multiple jurisdictions.

PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  For the FY 2006 - FY 2008 funding cycle, the Telehealth programs are building
  upon the projects' demonstrated skill in evaluation, providing healthcare, and, as
  appropriate, in legal and regulatory issues and in the provision of technical
  assistance. TNGP grantees are developing evaluation designs to measure process
  and outcomes. Quantitative outcomes will measure the following areas: impact
  on quality of care; appropriateness of use of the technology; whether access was
  improved; whether clinical outcomes were improved; and, how the cost of
  service delivery was affected in terms of efficiency and effectiveness of care.
  The TRCGP and LPGP are newly funded programs for FY 2006 and FY 2007.
  As such, these grantees are presently building organizational capacity. The
  TRCGP grantees are developing an extensive array of tools to provide technical
  assistance, and they are formulating an evaluation design to measure their
  impact on supporting the activities of existing or developing telehealth networks
  in their regions to meet the health care needs of rural or other populations to be
  served, including the improvement of access to services and the quality of the
  services received by those populations. The LPGP grantees are developing
  programs under which licensing boards of various States will cooperate to
  develop and implement State policies that will reduce statutory and regulatory
  barriers to telemedicine. These grants will continue to focus on licensure issues
  for physicians and nurses. The funded projects are to build on the first year of
  efforts to develop national models for addressing barriers to adoption of the
  Nurse Licensure Compact and implement model agreements to expedite the
  licensure process and eliminate redundancies associated with applying for
  physician licenses in multiple jurisdictions. The TNGP has been funded in past
  cycles. For the last full 3-year cycle of funding 15 grants were awarded from FY
  2003 - FY 2006. With approximately $3.75 million awarded to fund these 15
  grants, the TNGP improved access to specialty services for residents of
  underserved rural communities. With a population of 3.8 million individuals
  who lived in these underserved communities, access to specialty care was
                                                                                 1321
