  The Act provides that the apportionment among States shall be determined by         
  the Secretary after consultation with the Cooperative Forestry Research Advisory    
  Council. The statistical factors used for allocation of fund are: (1) Area of       
  nonfederal commercial forest land (40 percent) (and the source is "An Analysis      
  of the Timber Situation in the U.S.," 1952-2030, FS/USDA), (2) volume of            
  timber cut annually from growing stock (40 percent) (and the source is "An

PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
  Researchers in one State have completed a project studying the plant growth and
  environmental consequences of different "manufactured soil" materials
  developed from paper mill sludge and residuals. They have developed a research
  plan for paired watershed studies and focused on intensive quantitative soil
  sampling. This research provided information that helps determine the risk of
  air pollution, climate change, land application of residuals, or harvesting on
  forest health and associated freshwater quality.
