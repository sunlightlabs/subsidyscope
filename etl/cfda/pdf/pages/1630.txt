FEDERAL AGENCY:
  ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES, DEPARTMENT OF
  HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
AUTHORIZATION:
  Refugee Act of 1980, Section 412, 94 Stat. 111, 8 U.S.C. 1522, as amended,
  Public Laws 96-212, 97-363, and 99-605; Refugee Education Assistance Act of
  1980, Title V, 94 Stat. 1809, 8 U.S.C. 1522 note, as amended, Public Laws 96-
  422, 96-424, 97-35, 100-202, 100-436, 100-461, 101-167, 101-302, 101-513,
  and 101-517.
OBJECTIVES:
  To develop alternative projects which promote early employment of refugees,
  certain Amerasians from Viet Nam, Cuban and Haitian entrants, asylees, and
  certified victims of a severe form of trafficking. States, voluntary resettlement
  agencies, and other resettlement organizations may develop innovative
  approaches for the provision of refugee cash and medical assistance, otherwise
  available through the State-administered program. The purpose of the Wilson-
  Fish program is to provide integrated services that include cash assistance,
  medical assistance and other related services described above in order to
  increase refugees' prospects for early employment and self-sufficiency, reduce
  their level of welfare dependence, and promote coordination among voluntary
  resettlement agencies and services providers. In addition, the WF program
  allows ORR to ensure that refugee assistance programs exist in every State
  where refugees are resettled. Projects must serve all eligible refugees in a
  community. There are two categories for applications. Category one provides an
  opportunity for an applicant to continue the provision of refugee program
  services and assistance in a State when the State elects to discontinue
  participation or is not currently participating in the program of refugee
  resettlement. There are currently 7 WF programs which fall under Category one
  (Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, and South Dakota.
  Category two provides applicants an opportunity to implement alternative
  projects to promote self-sufficiency and coordinate services more effectively.
  There are 5 Category II WF programs (Colorado, Massachusetts, North Dakota,
  Vermont, and San Diego).
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Project Grants (Cooperative Agreements).
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  Funds may be used only for the purposes set forth in the grant award. Assistance
  is limited to refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, Amerasian
  immigrants, and certified trafficking victims, as defined in the authorizing Acts.
  The refugee must document his immigration status in order to be eligible for
  assistance. The scope of services available to refugees from Wilson/Fish grantees
  is similar to that of the State-Administered Refugee Resettlement Programs,
  which in turn is similar to regular domestic public assistance programs.
Applicant Eligibility:
  States, voluntary resettlement agencies, and other nonprofit refugee resettlement
  organizations may apply to initiate an alternative program. No separate funding
  is appropriated for Wilson/Fish demonstration projects. Funds are drawn instead
  from funds earmarked for refugee cash and medical assistance grants and social
  services allocations for the State-administered program (93.566) according to
  ORR projections.
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  Refugees, certain Amerasian immigrants, Cuban/Haitian entrants, asylees, and
  victims of a severe of trafficking are eligible for services and assistance through
  funded projects in a community. Cash assistance is transitional for up to 8
  months; services may be provided for a longer period of time.
Credentials/Documentation:
  Persons for whom assistance is authorized are limited to the following groups of
  aliens with appropriate documentation from the U.S. Citizenship and
  Immigration Service (USCIS), formerly Immigration and Naturalizations
  Services (INS): (1) Refugees admitted under section 207 of the INA and asylees
  admitted under section 208; (2) Cuban and Haitian entrants with documentation
  from the BCIS as to status allowed under section 501 of the Refugee Education
  Assistance Act of 1980; and certain Amerasian immigrants from Viet Nam
  admitted under section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and
  Related Programs Appropriations Act (1988) or title II of the Foreign
  Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Acts of
  1989, 1990, and 1991. Victims of a severe form of trafficking who have
  received a certification or eligibility letter from ORR are also eligible. Cost
  principles for States and local governments are found under OMB Circular No.
  A-87. Cost principles for nonprofit organizations are found in OMB Circular
  No. A-122.
Preapplication Coordination:
  Questions concerning the standing program announcement can be directed to the
  Office of Refugee Resettlement at (202) 205-5933. The Wilson/Fish program is
  excluded from coverage under E.O. 12372.
Application Procedure:
  Awards are granted on a competitive basis, as specified in the program
  announcements. Each agency desiring to respond to a program announcement is
  required to submit an application. Applications are reviewed and evaluated
                                                                                  1443
