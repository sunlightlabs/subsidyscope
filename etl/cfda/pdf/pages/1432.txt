  In fiscal year 2005, funds were provided to enable 56 States to provide             
  multifaceted systems of support services for family caregivers and for              
  grandparents or older individuals who are relative caregivers. In fiscal years      
  2006 and 2007, it is estimated that a similar number of grants will be made to      
  states, area agencies on aging, and Tribal Organizations. Project Grants (Title     
  VI-C): Funds are provided to Indian Tribal Organizations and Native Hawaiian        
  organizations to provide multifaceted systems or support services for family        
  caregivers and for grandparents or older individuals who are relative caregivers.

  interest of the homebound older adult. For Title VI, all of these criteria apply. In
  addition, an ITO may select the age that defines who is an older adult.
