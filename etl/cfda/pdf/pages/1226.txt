  hazardous substances co-mingled with petroleum) and up to $350,000 to address      
  sites contaminated by petroleum. Waiver requests must be based on the              
  anticipated level of contamination, size, or ownership status of the site. These   
  limits are mandatory under CERCLA 104(k)(4)(A). (2) For revolving loan fund        
  grants, an eligible entity may apply for up to $1,000,000 for an initial RLF grant.
  This limit is mandatory under CERCLA 104(k)(4)(A). In addition, coalitions of      
  eligible entities may apply together under one recipient for up to $1,000,000 per  
  eligible entity. (3) For cleanup grants, an eligible entity may apply for up to    
  $200,000 per site. The $200,000 per site limit is mandatory under CERCLA           
  104(k)(3)(A). Approximate average financial assistance is $200,000 for cleanup     
  grants, $200,000 for assessment grants and $1 million per entity for revolving     
  loan fund grants.                                                                  
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:                                                             
  This grant program replaced CFDA 66.811 in FY2003. EPA's brownfields               
  assistance has led to more than $11.3 billion in public and private investment in  
  cleanup and redevelopment, helped create more than 48,000 jobs, and resulted in    
  the assessment of more than 11,000 properties and the cleanup of more than 200     
  properties. In Fiscal Year 2007, EPA announced 294 grants, totaling $70.7          
  million. These included: (a) 189 assessment grants totaling $36.8 million, to      
  assess and plan for eventual cleanup at one or more brownfield sites; (b) 92       
  cleanup grants totaling $17.9 million, for recipients to clean up brownfield sites 
  they own; and (c) 13 revolving loan fund grants totaling $16 million, which        
  communities use to make low interest loans for the cleanup of brownfield sites.    
  In Fiscal Year 2008, EPA announced 314 grants, totaling over $74 million.          
  These included: (a) 194 assessment grants totaling $38.7 million to assess and     
  plan for cleanup at one or more brownfield sites; (b) 108 cleanup grants totaling  
  $19.6 million for recipients to clean up brownfield sites they own; and (c) 12     
  revolving loan fund grants totaling $15.7 million that communities can use to      
  make low interest loans for the cleanup of brownfield sites.

  This competitive grant program provides funding for three different kinds of       
  grants: assessment grants, revolving loan fund grants, and cleanup grants.         
  Assessment grants provide funding for a grant recipient to inventory,              
  characterize, assess, and conduct cleanup and redevelopment planning and           
  community involvement related to brownfield sites. Revolving Loan Fund grants      
  provide funding for a grant recipient to capitalize a revolving loan fund and to   
  provide subgrants to carry out cleanup activities at brownfield sites. Cleanup     
  grants provide funding for a grant recipient to carry out cleanup activities at



                                                                                11-08
  brownfield sites. Below are some examples of projects that were selected for
  funding in the past: In Fiscal Year 2004, EPA provided a brownfields
  assessment grant totalling $200,000 in hazardous substances funding. Hazardous
  substances grant funds will be used to assess mine-scarred properties in 4,000
  acres of a watershed, in order to prioritize properties for public acquisition and
  cleanup. Funds will be used for Phase I site assessments, Phase II site
  assessments on three to five high-priority sites, community outreach,
  environmental liability analysis, and GIS mapping. One significant mine will be
  assessed for possible acquisition, cleanup, and reuse as a historic mining
  museum and visitor center. In Fiscal Year 2004, EPA provided a brownfields
  assessment grant totalling $200,000 in petroleum funding. Petroleum grant
  funds will be used to identify and assess petroleum-contaminated sites and
  underground storage tanks. Grant funds will also be used to perform
  approximately four Phase I assessments and to develop redevelopment plans. In
  Fiscal Year 2003, EPA provided a brownfields revolving loan fund grant, which
  included $700,000 in hazardous substances funding and $300,000 in petroleum
  funding. The grant will be used to capitalize a revolving loan fund from which
  the recipient will provide loans and subgrants to conduct cleanup activities. The
  recipient's jurisdiction contains over 3,600 brownfields. They will use a
  community-based process to select sites. Sites throughout the county
  contaminated by hazardous substances and petroleum will be considered. In
  Fiscal Year 2004, EPA selected an Indian Community for a brownfields cleanup
  grant totalling $200,000 in petroleum funding. The grant will be used to clean
  up petroleum contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. Plans for
  site redevelopment include a Diabetes Education and Resource Center. In Fiscal
  Year 2004, EPA provided a brownfields assessment grant totalling $200,000 in
  hazardous substances funding. Grant funds will be used to complete an
  assessment of hazardous substances co-mingled with petroleum contamination
  at a 39-acre sawmill adjacent to the recipient city's central business district.
  Funds also will be used for community involvement and development of a
  cleanup plan.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
  This is a competitive grant program. The evaluation and selection criteria for
  competitive awards under this CFDA description will be described in the
  competitive announcement. Selection criteria will be outlined in the proposal
  guidelines and will be based on a system that includes the following ten statutory
  ranking criteria: (i) The extent to which a grant will stimulate the availability of
  other funds for environmental assessment or remediation, and subsequent reuse,
  of an area in which one or more brownfield sites are located.(ii) The potential of
  the proposed project or the development plan for an area in which one or more
  brownfield sites are located to stimulate economic development of the area on
  completion of the cleanup. (iii) The extent to which a grant would address or
  facilitate the identification and reduction of threats to human health and the
  environment, including threats in areas in which there is a greater-than-normal
  incidence of diseases or conditions (including cancer, asthma, or birth defects)
  that may be associated with exposure to hazardous substances, pollutants, or
  contaminants. (iv) The extent to which a grant would facilitate the use or reuse
  of existing infrastructure. (v) The extent to which a grant would facilitate the
  creation of, preservation of, or addition to a park, a greenway, undeveloped
  property, recreational property, or other property used for nonprofit purposes.
  (vi) The extent to which a grant would meet the needs of a community that has
  an inability to draw on other sources of funding for environmental remediation
  and subsequent redevelopment of the area in which a brownfield site is located
  because of the small population or low income of the community.(vii) The extent
  to which the applicant is eligible for funding from other sources.(viii) The extent
  to which a grant will further the fair distribution of funding between urban and
  nonurban areas.(ix) The extent to which the grant provides for involvement of
  the local community in the process of making decisions relating to cleanup and
  future use of a brownfield site.(x) The extent to which a grant would address or
  facilitate the identification and reduction of threats to the health or welfare of
  children, pregnant women, minority or low-income communities, or other
  sensitive populations. In addition, applicants will be required to demonstrate that
  site specific activities are carried out at sites that meet the definition of a
  Brownfields site at CERCLA 101(39).
