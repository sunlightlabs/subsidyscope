  HUD makes payments to owners of approved HUD-insured and non-insured                
  multifamily rental housing projects to supplement the partial rental payments of    
  eligible tenants. Rental projects were required to be part of an approved           
  workable program for community improvement or be approved by local                  
  government officials. Assistance covers the difference between the tenant's         
  payment and the basic market rental, but may not exceed 70 percent of the           
  market rental. The tenant's payment is between 25 and 30 percent of monthly         
  adjusted income or 30 percent of market rental, whichever is greater. This          
  program is inactive. No new projects are being approved; however, tenants may       
  apply for admission to existing projects.                                           
Applicant Eligibility:                                                                
  Eligible sponsors included nonprofit, cooperative, builder-seller, investor-        
  sponsor, and limited-distribution mortgagors.                                       
Beneficiary Eligibility:                                                              
  Families incomes must be within the income limits prescribed for admission to       
  Section 8 housing in order to qualify for benefits under this program. Families     
  may continue in occupancy if 30 percent of monthly income exceeds the market        
  rent.

  HUD makes monthly payments to project owners to make up the difference
  between the partial rentals paid by assisted tenants and the market rentals.
  Assisted tenants must pay between 25 and 30 percent of their adjusted monthly
  income (after certain deductions) or 30 percent of the market rent, whichever is
  greater. This program has maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements, see

  Individual family's assistance ceases when 30 percent of income is equal to or
  exceeds the market rent.

  approved by HUD. Defaults in meeting the mortgage terms must be reported. All
  mortgagors of HUD-insured projects are required to submit an annual financial
  statement to HUD.

  The Department of Housing and Urban Development reserves the right to audit
  the accounts of either the mortgagee or mortgagor to determine their compliance
  and conformance with HUD regulations and standards.
