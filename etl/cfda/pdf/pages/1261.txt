  In FY 2006 projects were solicited in the area of High Temperature                
  Superconductivity (HTS) and five awards were made in FY 2007. Two of the          
  research projects will help increase reliability and efficiency of HTS power      
  delivery cables, and the remaining three projects will place an emphasis on HTS   
  fault current limiters. These projects are in progress, and many will complete    
  their first phases in mid-2009. In FY 2007 projects were solicited in the area of 
  Visualization and Controls and Renewable and Distributed Systems Integration      
  (RDSI). Five awards were made at the end of the fiscal year for Visualization     
  and Controls to develop and integrate technologically- advanced controls and      
  cyber-security devices into our electric grid and energy infrastructure. In FY    
  2008 nine cooperative agreements were competitively selected to increase          
  efficiency in the nation's electricity grid under the Renewable and Distributed   
  Systems Integration.

  In FY 2007 projects were awarded for research that will advance the               
  development and application of High Temperature Superconductors, which have       
  the potential to alleviate congestion on an electricity grid that is experiencing 
  increased demand from consumers (http://www.energy.gov/news/5180.htm).            
  Projects awarded in FY 2007 for Visualization and Controls aim to protect our     
  Nation's energy infrastructure from cyber attacks and seek to modernize our       
  electricity grid (http://www.energy.gov/news/5643.htm). Projects awarded in       
  FY 2008 under Renewable and Distributed Systems Integration include research      
  and development activities to improve the security of controls systems for energy 
  delivery and increase the use of distributed generation during peak load periods  
  (http://www.energy.gov/news/6170.htm).
