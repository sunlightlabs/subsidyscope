Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:

Appeals:                                                                          
  None.                                                                           
Renewals:

Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                
  Federal agency funds 50 percent of State administrative costs, including the    
  costs of SNAP benefit fraud investigations and prosecutions costs of developing 
  certain computer systems as provided for in 7 CFR 277, and the cost incurred in 
  the verification of alien status. Administrative cost-sharing is authorized by  
  Section 16 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2025). By April 1, 1987 all  
  States were to implement an Employment Training (E&T) Program mandated by       
  Public Law 99-198. States' E&T programs are funded by individual grants         
  requiring no State matching; should a State's costs exceed the grant allocation,
  additional funding is available on a 50 percent basis. The Federal agency shall 
  also pay 50 percent of States' costs of reimbursing participants' costs of      
  dependent care as a result of E&T participation, not to exceed the applicable   
  local market rate and other reimbursable participant expenses, not to exceed $25
  per month per participant, and 50 percent of costs for case management or       
  casework to facilitate the transition from economic dependency to self-         
  sufficiency through work. The Balanced Budget Act (Public Law 105-33)           
  provides additional funding for grants to States (which do not require a State  
  match) for work/training programs generally targeted for non-working able-      
  bodied adults without dependents. These funds were reduced by Public Law        
  105-185. Nutrition education grants (authorized by Public Law 105-33 to         
  private nonprofit organizations or State agencies are available with the Federal
  share of costs limited to 50 percent.

  Local Governments, and Nonprofit Organizations," State and local government,    
  and Nonprofit organizations that expend Federal financial assistance of         
  $500,000 or more within any fiscal year shall have either a single audit or (in 
  certain cases) a program specific audit made for that year. Audits may be       
  conducted less frequently under conditions specified in OMB Circular No. A-     
  133.
