  Rural communities can use these funds to correct drinking water problems that       
  have been created by a significant decline in quantity or quality of their water    
  supply. The communities use the funds for new systems, waterline extensions,        
  construction of water sources and treatment facilities, storage tanks, and repairs  
  or renovation of existing systems.

  or less that has a median household income of not more than 70 percent of the       
  statewide nonmetropolitan household income and had a significant decline in         
  quantity of water available from private individually owned wells will be given     
  priority. Preference also will be given to proposed projects that will assist an    
  established water system or remedy an acute shortage of quality water. The          
  Rural Development State Director will rate applications on a point system and       
  points received will be considered in selecting projects for funding.
