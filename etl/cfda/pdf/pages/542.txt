TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:

  Operating subsidy funds are provided to PHAs to achieve and maintain adequate       
  operating and maintenance service and reserve funds. Funds are made to PHAs         
  based on the extent to which their projected total allowable expenses (as           
  determined by formula) exceed their projected income (also as determined by         
  formula) from rents and other sources.                                              
Applicant Eligibility:                                                                
  Public Housing Agencies established in accordance with State law are eligible.      
  The proposed program must be approved by the local governing body. Pursuant         
  to the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996,       
  Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) are no longer eligible for funding under the      
  U.S. Housing Act (of 1937) or the Indian Housing Act.                               
Beneficiary Eligibility:                                                              
  Lower income families which include citizens or eligible immigrants. The term       
  "Families" includes but is not limited to: (1) a family with or without children;   
  (2) an elderly family (head, spouse, or sole member 62 years or older), (3) near    
  elderly family (head, spouse, or sole member 50 years old but less than 62 years    
  old); (4) a disabled family; (5) a displaced family; (6) the remaining member of    
  a tenant family; or (7) a single person who is neither elderly, near-elderly,       
  displaced, or a person with disabilities.                                           
Credentials/Documentation:                                                            
  The applicant must support the application/proposal by furnishing data that the     
  program is consistent with the Public Housing Agency (PHA) Plan (Quality            
  Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998). The PHA Plan is designed for          
  both long-term and short-term strategies for addressing the housing needs of the    
  community. The proposed program should demonstrate that it is responsive to         
  the PHA Plan by identifying conditions of the housing stock in the community        
  and the housing assistance needs of lower-income families (including the            
  elderly, persons with disabilities, large families and those displaced or who will  
  be displaced) residing in or expected to reside in the community.

  required for this program. This program is eligible for coverage under E.O.

  consult the office or official designated as the single point of contact in his or  
  her State for more information on the process the State requires to be followed in
