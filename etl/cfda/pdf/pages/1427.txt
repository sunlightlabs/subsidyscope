  To encourage State Agencies on Aging and Area Agencies on Aging to                 
  concentrate resources to develop and implement comprehensive and coordinated       
  community-based systems of service for older individuals via Statewide             
  planning, and area planning and provision of supportive services, including        
  multipurpose senior centers. The objective of these services and centers is to     
  maximize the informal support provided to older Americans to enable them to        
  remain in their homes and communities. Providing transportation services, in-      
  home services, and caregiver support services, this program insures that elders    
  receive the services they need to remain independent.                              
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:

USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                           
  Funds are awarded to States to develop and strengthen comprehensive and            
  coordinated service delivery systems through designated State Agencies on          
  Aging and Area Agencies on Aging. A State plan covering 2, 3, or 4 years, with     
  annual amendments as necessary, must be submitted for approval to the              
  Assistant Secretary for Aging. Area Plans also cover 2, 3, or 4 years, and are to  
  be submitted to State agencies for approval. These funds are distributed by        
  intrastate funding formulas to area agencies in States with planning and service   
  areas and directly to service providers in the 13 States designated as single-     
  planning-and-service-area States. In addition to supportive nutrition services,    
  these funds may be used to support other services including the renovation,        
  acquisition and alteration, and construction of multipurpose senior centers.
