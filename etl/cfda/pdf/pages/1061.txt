OBJECTIVES:
  To assist public and nonprofit private entities in establishing new programs and

TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Project Grants.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  The Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Service Programs Act of 1992 (Public

  through per diem payments.

  Applicants eligible for grants include public and nonprofit private entities with
  the capacity to effectively administer a grant; which demonstrate that adequate
  financial support will be available to carry out the project; and which agree to
  and demonstrate capacity to meet the applicable criteria and requirements of the
  grant program. Applicants eligible for per diem payments include public or
  nonprofit private entities who are either grant recipients, or who are eligible to
  receive a grant. Programs eligible for coverage under per diem payments must
  have been established after November 10, 1992.

  service, and who was discharged or released there from under conditions other

  organizations.

  applications for the grant program and information on applications for
  requesting eligibility to receive per diem payments. This program is excluded
  from coverage under E.O. 12372.
Application Procedure:
  The application forms required by 38 CFR 17.700, "VA Homeless Providers
  Grant and Per Diem Program," and furnished by the Federal agency must be
  used for the program.
