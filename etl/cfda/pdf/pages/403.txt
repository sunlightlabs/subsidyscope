OBJECTIVES:                                                                              
  The objectives of the eight Regional Fishery Management Councils are to                
  prepare, monitor and revise fishery management plans and data collection               
  programs for domestic and foreign fishing within the 200-mile U.S. Exclusive           
  Economic Zone (EEZ). This is done with approval and implementation by the              
  Secretary of Commerce who has stewardship responsibility for living marine             
  resources in the EEZ under the MSFCMA.                                                 
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                     
  Project Grants (Cooperative Agreements).                                               
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                               
  Funds are used by the eight Regional Fishery Management Councils to prepare            
  plans and amendments to recommend to the Secretary of Commerce, under the              
  MSFCMA.                                                                                
Applicant Eligibility:                                                                   
  Eight Regional Fishery Management Councils (New England, Mid-Atlantic,                 
  South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, Pacific, North Pacific and Western          
  Pacific) as established by the MSFCMA. These councils can best be described            
  as "quasi-government" because they are sponsored by the Federal government,            
  specifically funded by Congress but the members are appointed by the Secretary         
  of Commerce from the private sector; they are not Federal employees.                   
Beneficiary Eligibility:                                                                 
  This program benefits commercial and recreational fishing enterprises in the           
  EEZ. Foreign fishing enterprises may also benefit from this program if                 
  authorized to conduct fishing operations. U.S. consumers will benefit as a result      
  of availability of seafood. Imports may be reduced and exports may be                  
  increased.

  Generally a work plan for the funding year.                                            
Preapplication Coordination:

  directly included in this program, though each coastal State has an official
