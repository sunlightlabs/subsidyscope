PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  The NASA Innovative Partnerships Program has helped many industrial,

  educational, and government organizations develop new products, increase

  productivity, reduce costs, and improve the quality of life for US citizens.

  Typically, the IP Program provides user access to aerospace technology in

  support of technical problem solving. For example, sensor technology,

  microelectronics and telemetry systems have been adapted and applied in the

  development of a range of biomedical implantable devices to control or

  otherwise administer corrective treatment of diseases or bodily functions or

  ailments, such as diabetes or intractable pain. Many industrial uses of aerospace

  technology have occurred, including: wireless infrared communications systems;

  manufacturing scheduling enhancements; structural analysis of industrial

  products and systems, and a host of materials applications in new and improved

  products. NASA computer programs are routinely adapted and used by hundreds

  of U.S. companies annually, with substantial savings in software development

  costs. During the past year, over 200,000 individuals and firms were given

  access to new ideas and improvements from NASA resulting in new products

  and processes. Over 27,000 technical innovations from the space program have

  been published and are now available for use by American industry by

  subscribing to NASA Tech Briefs.
