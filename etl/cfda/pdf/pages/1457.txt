  Applications will be evaluated in 2007 on the 2005 data including the total           
  number of cases reported, the number of bacteriologically confirmed cases             
  reported, the bacteriologically substantiated rate of disease, the number of          
  tuberculosis cases among racial and ethnic minorities, significant tuberculosis       
  problems among the homeless, cumulative number of TB/AIDS cases, and                  
  significant increases in tuberculosis morbidity. The number of tuberculosis cases

  tuberculosis drugs will also be considered in evaluating and prioritizing projects
