  readily available and verifiable: (1) Beach season length, (2) beach miles, and      
  (3) beach use. The grants allocation formula sums three parts. The first part is a   
  base amount for all States and Territories that varies with the length of the beach  
  season. The second part distributes 50 percent of the total remaining funds based    
  on the ratio of shoreline miles in a State or territory to the total length of       
  shoreline miles. The third part distributes the remaining 50 percent based on the    
  ratio of coastal population in a State or territory to the total coastal population. 
  This program has no matching requirements.                                           
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                                 
  Beach grants are normally funded on a 12-month basis (yearly). However, EPA          
  may negotiate the project period, grant continuations, and grant amendments          
  with each applicant based on project requirements.                                   
Reports:                                                                               
  Semi-annual or annual reports, as required by the specific terms of the              
  Agreement. Financial Status Reports must be submitted for each project at the        
  end of each fiscal year.                                                             
Audits:                                                                                
  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the       
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,       
  other EPA staff, or any authorized representative of the Federal government.         
  Reviews by the EPA Project Officer and the Grants Specialist may occur each          
  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,          
  June 27, 2003), "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit                 
  Organizations," non-federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in       
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that    
  year. Non-federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal          
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted     
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.

  Financial records, including all documents to support entries on accounting          
  records and to substantiate charges to each grant, must be kept available to         
  personnel authorized to examine EPA grant accounts. All records must be              
  maintained for 3 years from the date of submission of the annual financial status    
  report. If questions still remain, such as those raised as a result of audit, related
  records should be retained until the matter is completely resolved.                  
Account Identification:

  All 35 states and territories that qualify for the BEACH Act Grant program were      
  awarded grants in FY 07. In FY 08, EPA awarded grants to all 35 coastal and          
  Great Lakes states and territories, and eligible tribes that qualified for the       
  BEACH Act Grant program. Program benefits from funding in FY 07 and FY 08            
  include: development and implementation of recreational water quality                
  monitoring protocol (sampling design, indicator organism); decreasing swimmer        
  exposure by improving communication outreach and education to public on              
  swimming advisories; establishing more efficient and timely management               
  decision process for posting swimming advisories; and constructing databases to

  provide government and public access to data and information.

RELATED PROGRAMS:
  None.
EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  Development and implementation of beach monitoring programs; development
  of databases and websites; purchase of lab equipment for water quality
  monitoring; construction and posting of signs on beaches; and purchase of
  vehicles for monitoring.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
  To be eligible for program implementation grants, applicants must meet program
  performance criteria outlined in National Beach Guidance and Required
  Performance Criteria for Grants (EPA-823-B-02-004). The performance criteria
  set forth implementation grant requirements for monitoring and assessing
  recreation waters and promptly notifying the public of exceedances of water
  quality for pathogens. As a condition of receipt of a program Implementation
  Grant under Section 406(b) of the Clean Water Act, a State or local government
  program for monitoring and notification under this section shall identify: (1)
  lists of coastal recreation waters in the State, including coastal recreation waters
  adjacent to beaches or similar points of access that are used by the public; (2) in
  the case of a State program for monitoring and notification, the process by
  which the State may delegate to local governments responsibility for
  implementing the monitoring and notification program; (3) the frequency and
  location of monitoring and assessment of coastal recreation waters based on: (a)
  the periods of recreational use of the waters; (b) the nature and extent of use
  during certain periods; (c) the proximity of the waters to known point sources
  and nonpoint sources of pollution; and (d) any effect of storm events on the
  waters; (4)(a) the methods to be used for detecting levels of pathogens and
  pathogen indicators that are harmful to human health; and (b) the assessment
  procedures for identifying short-term increases in pathogens and pathogen
  indicators that are harmful to human health in coastal recreation waters
  (including increases in relation to storm events); (5) measures for prompt
  communication of the occurrence, nature, location, pollutants involved, and
  extent of any exceeding of, or likelihood of exceeding, applicable water quality
  standards for pathogens and pathogen indicators to: (a) the Administrator, in
  such form as the Administrator determines to be appropriate; and (b) a
  designated official of a local government having jurisdiction over land adjoining
  the coastal recreation waters for which the failure to meet applicable standards is
  identified; (6) measures for the posting of signs at beaches or similar points of
  access, or functionally equivalent communication measures that are sufficient to
  give notice to the public that the coastal recreation waters are not meeting or are
  not expected to meet applicable water quality standards for pathogens and
  pathogen indicators; and (7) measures that inform the public of the potential
  risks associated with water contact activities in the coastal recreation waters that
  do not meet applicable water quality standards.
66.473 DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION TRIBAL
COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS
   (DITCA)
FEDERAL AGENCY:
  OFFICE OF WATER, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
AUTHORIZATION:
  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2006, Public Law 109-54 (2006).
OBJECTIVES:
  Direct Implementation Tribal Cooperative Agreements (DITCAs) enable EPA to
  award cooperative agreements to federally recognized Indian tribes and eligible
  intertribal consortia to help carry out the Agency's function to implement
  directly, Federal environmental programs required or authorized by law in the
  absence of an acceptable tribal program, notwithstanding the Federal Grant and
  Cooperative Agreement Act. DITCAs are an increasingly important avenue for
  EPA and the tribes to realize meaningful environmental protection in Indian
  Country. DITCAs enable EPA to partner with tribes help fulfill EPA's direct
  implementation authorities, yield environmental results, and assist the Agency in
  meeting its Strategic Plan goals and targets.DITCAs also provide tribes with the
  flexibility and opportunity by allowing tribes, through a workplan with EPA and
  under federal authority, to choose aspects of a program that address their tribal
  environmental needs and priorities, to determine the scope and pace of tribal
  involvement, and to build tribal capacity to implement environmental programs.
   Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2008: The program provides another avenue for
  tribes and EPA to partner in implementing meaningful environmental protection
  in Indian Country. DITCAs provide tribes with the flexibility and opportunity to
  develop staff capacity to manage environmental programs, to address specific
  tribal environmental needs and priorities that are within EPA's authority for
                                                                                     961
