CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:

  The Bureau's main objective is to help ensure that refugees and victims of

  conflict have access to basic life-sustaining resources in ways that meet

  internationally accepted standards of care in shelter, food supply, nutrition,

  water supply, sanitation, and public health. NGO proposals should clearly use

  SPHERE standards as the basis for design, implementation, and evaluation,

  including proposed objectives and indicators. Underlying PRM's support for

  humanitarian assistance is a commitment to protection, targeted support to

  women, vulnerable individuals, coordination with relevant UN agencies and

  other NGOs, sustainability of programming, security, and capacity building.

  NGOs in search of Bureau funding would do well to address these specific areas

  in any proposals sent for funding.
