  Social Security Act of 1935, Title XVI, as amended; 42 U.S.C. 1381-1383f.         
OBJECTIVES:                                                                         
  To ensure a minimum level of income to persons who have attained age 65 or        
  are blind or disabled, and whose income and resources are below specified         
  levels.                                                                           
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                
  Direct Payments with Unrestricted Use; Direct Payments for Specified Use.         
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                          
  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments are made to persons who have

                                                                                    
  attained age 65 or who are blind or disabled and meet the means-tested and other  
  requirements of the program. Generally, there are no restrictions on the use of   
  benefits received by beneficiaries, although the right to future benefits is not  
  transferable or assignable. The Federal government gives the States funds, in     
  advance or by way of reimbursement, for necessary costs in making disability      
  determinations under 20 CFR 404 subparts P and Q and part 416 subparts I and      
  J. Necessary costs are direct as well as indirect costs as defined in 41 CFR 1-15,
  subpart 1-15.7 of the Federal Procurement Regulations System for costs incurred   
  before April 1, 1984; and 48 CFR 31, Subpart 31.6 of the Federal Acquisition      
  Regulations System and Federal Management Circular No. A-74-4 as amended          
  or superseded for costs incurred after March 31, 1984.

                                                                                    
Applicant Eligibility:                                                              
  To be found disabled for SSI purposes: an individual age 18 or older must be      
  unable to perform any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically     
  determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in     
  death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at
  least 12 months; an individual under age 18 must have a medically determinable

                                                                                    
  physical or mental impairment or combination of impairments that causes           
  marked and severe functional limitations, and that can be expected to cause       
  death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at 
  least 12 months. An individual under age 18 who files a new application for       
  benefits and is engaging in substantial gainful activity will not be considered   
  disabled. To be found blind for SSI purposes, an individual of any age must be    
  "statutorily blind." This means central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the    
  better eye with use of a correcting lens. The eligibility of an individual who has
  attained age 65 or who is blind or disabled is determined on the basis of an      
  assessment of the individual's monthly income and resources, citizenship or       
  alien status, U.S. residency, and certain other eligibility requirements. In      
  determining a month's income, the first $20 of Social Security or other unearned  
  income is not counted. An additional $65 of earned income ($85 if the person      
  had no unearned income) received in a month plus one-half of the remainder        
  above $65 (or $85) also is not counted. If, after these (and other) exclusions, an
  individual's countable income, effective January 2004, is less than $564 per      
  month ($846 for a couple, both of whom are aged, blind or disabled) and           


                                                                               11-08
  countable resources are less than $2,000 ($3,000 for a couple), the individual
  may be eligible for payments. The values of household goods, personal effects,
  an automobile, life insurance, and property needed for self support are, if within
  limits set out in regulations, excluded in determining value of resources. Burial
  spaces for an individual and immediate family and burial funds, up to $1,500
  each for an individual and spouse, are excluded from resources. The value of a
  home which serves as the principal place of residence is also excluded in
  resource valuation.
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  Individuals who have attained age 65 or are blind or disabled, who continue to
  meet the income and resources tests, citizenship/qualified alien status, U.S.
  residence, and certain other requirements. Eligibility may continue for
  beneficiaries who engage in substantial gainful activity despite disabling
  physical or mental impairments.
Credentials/Documentation:
  Proof of age, marital status, income and resources, establishment of blindness or
  disability, proof of residence in the U.S. and citizenship, or alien status is
  required.
Preapplication Coordination:
  None. This program is excluded from coverage under E.O. 12372.
Application Procedure:
  Call toll free at 1-800-772-1213 or telephone or visit the local Social Security
  Office.
Award Procedure:
  The individual (and representative payee, if any,) will be notified by mail of
  award or denial.
Deadlines:
  None. Benefits are not paid prior to the month following the month of
  application. However, an emergency advance payment may be available in the
  month of filing the application.
Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:
  Not applicable.
Appeals:
  Call toll free at 1 (800) 772-1213 or telephone or visit the local Social Security
  Office. The appeal process ranges from a case review or field office conference
  to a review by the Federal Courts. An appeal must be requested within 60 days
  of the date on which a written notice of SSA's initial determination is received
  by the applicant. The 60 days start the day after you receive the notice.
Renewals:
  A redetermination of a person's benefit amount and continuing eligibility will be
  made on a scheduled basis at periodic intervals. Unscheduled redeterminations
  are made when changes in circumstances are reported. The length of time
  between scheduled redetermination varies depending on the likelihood that the
  beneficiary's situation may change in a way that affects payment amount or
  eligibility.
Formula and Matching Requirements:
  This program has no statutory formula. Some mandatory State supplements are
  required by supplemental security income law to maintain former State
  recipients' December 1973 payment levels at pre-supplemental security income
  levels, increased by cost-of-living adjustments, where such payments were
  higher than the initial supplemental security income standards. States also have
  the option of paying supplements. The Social Security Administration will
  administer for a fee under agreements with States both mandatory and optional
  State supplements. States paying supplements are required by supplemental
  security income law to maintain either their State supplement expenditures or
  their payment levels when Federal standards are increased.
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:
  Benefits are paid monthly. Accrued benefits are paid in a lump sum unless they
  exceed a specified amount in which case they are paid in up to three installments
  at 6 month intervals. In the case of a disabled child, accrued payments over a
  certain amount must be retained in a dedicated account and used only for certain
  approved expenditures.
Reports:
  Any change of address or any event affecting eligibility or benefit amount (such
  as an increase in resources or income or improvement of disabling condition)
  must be reported to the Social Security Administration when the event occurs.
Audits:
  None.
Records:
  None.
Account Identification:
  75-0406-0-1-609.

  Monthly Federal cash payments range from $1 to $637 for an aged, blind, or
  disabled individual who does not have an eligible spouse, and from $1 to $956
  for an aged, blind, or disabled individual and an eligible spouse. These rates
                                                                                 1595
