  Formula and Matching Requirements: (1) Formula Grants: State allotments are          
  computed based on the number of children receiving food stamps over a three          
  year rolling average. Allotments to Indian Tribes, including Tribal consortia are    
  based on a percent set aside of the total appropriation in each fiscal year and      
  computed based on the number of children in the tribe compared to the total          
  number of children in eligible Indian Tribes. However, grants will not be made       
  to Indian Tribes whose allotment is less than $10,000. Allotments to Territories     
  are based on the formula in subpart 1of Title IV-B. Match: FFP is 75 percent of      
  expenditures: grantees must provide a 25 percent match. (2) Discretionary            
  Grants: matching requirements are described in each program announcement.

  Grants are generally available for a 12-, 24-, or 36- month period. Some may be

  fiscal year, the States and Indian Tribes must perform a final review of progress    
  toward accomplishment of the goals. (2) Discretionary Grants: Financial and
