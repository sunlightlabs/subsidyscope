  On April 25, 2003, the President's Committee on Mental Retardation (PCMR)
  was renamed the President's Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities
  by President George W. Bush. This was done through amendment of Executive
  order 12994. The technical Report to the President, "A Charge We Have to
  Keep: A Road Map to Personal and Economic Freedom for People with
  Intellectual Disabilities", was prepared by the President's Committee for People
  with Intellectual Disabilities and offers recommendations, pursuant to the New
  Freedom Initiative, on strategies, policies and programs toward providing
  Americans with intellectual disabilities more opportunities to earn, develop
  skills, work, make choices about their daily lives, and be integrated into their
  communities. Accompanying the technical report is a Companion Booklet
  summarizing the Committee's recommendations to the President. The
  Companion Booklet was designed for Americans with intellectual disabilities
                                                                                1461
