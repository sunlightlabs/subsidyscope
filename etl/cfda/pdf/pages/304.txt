  Most grants are approved on the basis of negotiated targets or objectives to be     
  achieved. However, grants to rural communities are based on regional and area       
  criteria for meeting the needs and opportunities of the communities. UCF            
  community grants are based on local needs and resources. A specific project         
  focus may be developed by State Urban Forestry Councils.
