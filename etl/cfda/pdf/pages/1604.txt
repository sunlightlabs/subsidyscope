  Fiscal year 2007 Centers funded 193 total research Centers which included 63       
  Cores, 62 SPOREs and 5 Specialized Centers. Fiscal year 2008 will fund an          
  estimated 170 total Centers which will include 61 Cores, 59 SPOREs and 5           
  Specialized Centers. Fiscal year 2009 will fund an estimated 170 total Centers     
  which will include 61 Cores, 59 SPOREs and 5 Specialized Centers. Cancer           
  Centers are supported through the P30 grant mechanism as Cancer Center             
  Support Grants (CCSGs), which fall into two categories as follows: cancer          
  centers and comprehensive cancer centers. Policies and guidelines governing the    
  main instrument of support, the Cancer Center Support Grant, have recently         
  been revised. The P20 Cancer Center Planning Grants have been discontinued.        
  However, considerable progress is being made in working with smaller, less         
  research intensive institutions in areas of the country that have no NCI-          
  designated cancer centers. The NCI will work with these institutions very closely  
  in the future.

  The major elements in evaluating applications include the following: (1) An        
  adequate base of established programs of high quality in laboratory and clinical   
  cancer research; (2) research activity in a variety of disciplines, and evidence of
  high degree of interdisciplinary coordination, interaction and cooperation among   
  center members; (3) appropriate and adequate organization and facilities for the   
  conduct and evaluation of center activities; (4) a qualified director with adequate
  authority; and (5) an adequate commitment of the parent institution or             
  institutions to the cancer center. The center should be recognized as a major      
  element within the organizational structure.
