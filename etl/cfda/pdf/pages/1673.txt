PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:                                                               
  Section 6201 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, Public Law 109-171)          
  provides for $2 billion dollars in additional federal payments under Hurricane       
  Katrina related multi-state section 1115 demonstrations. The legislation             
  indiciated specific categories of expenditures for which these funds may be used.    
  Initially, following enactment of the DRA, based on States' FY 2006 estimates of     
  the DRA defined expenditure categories (from States with approved multi-state        
  Hurricane Katrina demonstrations), we provided grant awards totaling $1.5            
  billion to 32 States. Although DRA provided for a total of $2 billion for Katrina    
  relief, we initially held back $500 million with the intent of obtaining updated     
  State estimates which would inform a subsequent disposition of such funds.           
  Based on updated estimates, CMS determined that for 11 states their initial          
  allocation (of the $1.5 billion) was not sufficient for their projected FY 2006      
  expenditures. We issued those states an additional $363,912,798 in grant             
  authority in late September for total FY 2006 obligations of $1,863,912,798.         
  The resulting unobligated carryover into FY 2007 was $136,087,202. Delayed           
  state payment processing of Katrina-related relief provider claims through the       
  fourth quarter of FY 2006 necessitates the issuance of additional grant authority    
  to states for FY 2007. CMS plans to recove an an estimated $450 million from         
  the approximately $1.9 billion originally obligated in FY 2006 by reconciling        
  each state's FY 2006 grants with actual expenditures reported on the                 
  states'cumulative expenditures reports through the 4th quarter FY 2006. CMS          
  will use the $450 million in estimated prior period recoveries and the FY 2006       
  unobligated carryover to provide FY 2007 grant authority to the states, as needed    
  for payment of FY 2006 dates of service which are being paid in FY 2007. By          
  reconciling each state's FY 2007 grants with actual expenditures through the 1st     
  quarter FY 2007, we will be able to determine the further disposition of any         
  remaining DRA funds.
