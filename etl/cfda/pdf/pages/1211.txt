  whichever is longer. At the ten-year mark, the TAG financial records may be       
  disposed of after first getting written approval to do so from the EPA.           
  Alternately, a recipient may choose to submit financial records to the EPA for    
  safekeeping when the final Financial Status Report is submitted. (4) Each         
  recipient must send to EPA a copy of each final written product prepared by       
  their technical advisor as part of the TAG. EPA will send the final written       
  products to the local Superfund site information repository(ies) where all site-  
  related documents are available to the public.

Obligations:                                                                        
  (Includes initial awards and additional funds)FY 07 $926,952; FY 08 est           
  $600,000 ($50,000 awarded as of 5/1/2008); and FY 09 est $500,000.                
Range and Average of Financial Assistance:                                          
  Initial awards for assistance agreements awarded under this CFDA number will      
  not exceed $50,000. After the initial award, additional funding may be awarded    
  based on the criteria detailed under 40 CFR 35.4065, and subject to the           
  availability of funds. The average additional award is $40,000 (per agreement).   
  Since 1988, 307 TAGs have been awarded. Of these, 114 grantees were awarded       
  $50,000 or less; 160 grantees have received awards with a cumulative value        
  between $51,000 and $150,000; 33 grantees have received awards with a             
  cumulative value ranging between $151,000 and $250,000; and 9 grantees have       
  received awards whose cumulative value totals of more than $250,000. The          
  cumulative award value includes the initial award and any supplemental funding    
  awards over the life of the agreement.                                            
PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS:                                                            
  Since the program began on March 24, 1988, 307 awards have been issued by         
  EPA, totaling more than $25,900,000 in TAG awards (including new awards,          
  additional funds, waivers and deviation). In most cases, EPA receives only one    
  application for a site and in most cases an award is made. In FY 07 ten new       
  grants were awarded ($375,000) and 12 established grantees were awarded           
  additional funds ($552,000). As of May 1, 2008, one new grant has been            
  awarded ($25,000) and one established grantee was awarded additional funds        
  ($25,000) for FY 08: it is anticipated that five more new awards ($250,000) and   
  five more existing grantees will be awarded supplemental funding ($250,000) by    
  the end of FY 08. The grant includes an outreach component wherein the grantee    
  helps to educate the broader community on issues related to the site cleanup.     
  Under this grant, grantees have developed community newsletters, developed        
  web sites, conducted community meetings to help other community members           
  better understand technical information related to the site cleanup and to better 
  respond to site-related technical documents during public comment periods.        
  Technical comments provided to EPA under this grant assist EPA in meeting         
  Superfund strategic targets of identifying and controlling unacceptable human     
  exposures from site contamination; monitoring and controlling migration of        
  contaminated ground water; and identifying a final remedy suitable for stated     
  reuse (under Goal 3.2.2 of EPA's Strategic Plan).

EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:
  A TAG allows a group to procure independent technical advisors to help in
  interpreting and commenting on site-related information and decisions.
  Examples of how a technical advisor can help a group include, but are not
  limited to: (a) Reviewing preliminary site assessment/site investigation data; (b)
  Participating in public meetings to help interpret information about site
  conditions, proposed remedies, and the implementation of a remedy; (c) Visiting
  the site vicinity periodically during cleanup, if possible, to observe progress and
  provide technical updates to the group; (d) Interpreting information related to
  redevelopment; and (e) Evaluating future land use options based on land use
  assumptions found in the remedial investigation/feasibility study.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
  The evaluation and selection criteria for competitive awards under this CFDA
  description are described in the programmatic regulations (40 CFR Part 35) as
  follow. In selecting a proposal: 1) EPA will determine if a group meets the
  following eligibility criteria: (a) The community group is a group of people who
  may be "affected" by a release or a threatened release at any facility listed on the
  NPL or proposed for listing under the NCP where a response action is underway;
  and (b) The group meets the minimum administrative and management
  capability requirements found in 40 CFR 30.21 by demonstrating they have or
  will have reliable procedures for record keeping and financial accountability
  related to managing the TAG. 2) EPA will also determine if there are factors
  which make the group ineligible. A group is ineligible if: (a) The group is a
  "potentially responsible party" (PRP), receives money or services from a PRP, or
  represent a PRP; (b) The group is "affiliated" with a national organization; (c)
  The group is an academic institution; (d) The group is a political subdivision; (e)
  The group was established or is presently sustained by any of the ineligible
  entities listed above; or (f) The group is not incorporated as a nonprofit
  organization for the specific purpose of representing affected people except as
  provided in 40 CFR 35.4045. 3) Once EPA determines if eligibility requirements
  have been met, the Agency considers whether and how successfully a group
  meets the following, equally weighted, criteria: (a) Representation of groups and
  individuals affected by the site; (b) The group's plans to use the services of a
  technical advisor throughout the Superfund response action; and (c) The group's
  ability and plan to inform others in the community of the information provided
  by the technical advisor. 4) Additionally, a group must incorporate as a
  nonprofit for the purpose of participating in decision making at the Superfund
  site for which the TAG was granted (for exception see 40 CFR 35.4045).
  Applicant groups should consult the Superfund TAG Handbooks, "Applying for
  a Grant" and "The Application Forms with Instructions," for detailed
  instructions on applying for a TAG.
