  Governments (Other than Federally Recognized), Regional Organizations, and         
  Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Organizations). Eligible Individuals:    
   Any individual, or individuals (multiple PDs/PIs), with the skills, knowledge,    
  and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the PD/PI is         
  invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support.   
  Individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as              
  individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for NIH support.      
  SBIR grants can be awarded only to domestic small businesses (entities that are    
  independently owned and operated for profit, are not dominant in the field in      
  which research is proposed, and have no more than 500 employees). Primary          
  employment (more than one-half time) of the principal investigator must be with    
  the small business at the time of award and during the conduct of the proposed     
  project. In both Phase I and Phase II, the research and/or development must be     
  performed in the U.S. and its possessions. To be eligible, an SBIR grant           
  application must be approved for scientific merit and program relevance by a       
  scientific review group and by a national advisory council. STTR grants can be     
  awarded only to domestic small business concerns (entities that are                
  independently owned and operated for profit, are not dominant in the field in      
  which research is proposed and have no more than 500 employees) which              
  "partner" with a research institution in cooperative research and development. At  
  least 40 percent of the project is to be performed by the small business concern   
  and at least 30 percent by the research institution. In both Phase I and Phase II, 
  the research must be performed in the U.S. and its possessions. To be eligible for 
  funding, a grant application must be approved for scientific and technical merit   
  and program relevance by a scientific review group and a national advisory         
  council.

  Applications are reviewed by primarily nonfederal consultants recruited            
  nationwide. The amount of the award and period of support are determined on        
  the basis of scientific merit of the project as well as financial and programmatic 
  consideration. SBIR and STTR Grant Solicitations and SBIR Contract                 
  Solicitation may be obtained electronically through the NIH's "Small Business

  Project grants recommended for approval by the appropriate National Advisory       
  Council and approved for payment are awarded directly by NIDA to the               
  applicant institution. All accepted, research projects, SBIR/STTR applications     
  are evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate scientific peer 
  review panel and by the National Advisory Council. All applications receiving a    
  priority score compete for available SBIR/STTR set-aside funds on the basis of     
  scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the proposed research,  
  program relevance, and program balance among the areas of research.
