Award Procedure:                                                                       
  Procedures for each project are specified in the applicable request for proposals.

                                                                                       
  Generally, the procedure is as follows: A technical review panel composed of

  staff from ETA program offices as well as peer reviewers evaluates eligible          
  submitted applications. The panel prepares a report for the ETA Grant Officer        
  identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the application and the cumulative

  rating. Once selections are made by the Grant Officer, an Award Notification is      
  sent through the appropriate congressional channels for notification. After          
  awardees are notified, the list of awardees is posted on the ETA website at          
  www.doleta.gov. If an application is rejected, a letter is sent to the applicant as  
  notification that they were not selected as a recipient of the grant.                
Deadlines:

  Renewals with funds are not available. However, with significant justification       
  ETA may elect to exercise its option to award no-cost extensions to these grants     
  for an additional period at its own discretion, based on the success of the          
  program and other relevant factors.

  however, applicants are encouraged to leverage the resources of the partnership      
  whenever possible.
