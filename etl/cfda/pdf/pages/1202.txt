Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                  
  This program does not have a statutory formula. However, EPA requires a           
  minimum 5% match of the total allowable project cost. For example, the Federal    
  government will provide 95% of the total allowable cost of the project and the    
  recipient will provide the remaining 5%. The match may be issued in the form of   
  cash and/or in-kind contributions, e.g., donated services, charges for real       
  property and equipment or the value of goods and services directly benefiting the 
  EPA funded project.                                                               
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                              
  Assistance agreements are awarded for a project period not to exceed 2 years.     
  Funds are released by a letter of credit.                                         
Reports:                                                                            
  Uniform reporting requirements for institutions of higher education and other     
  non- profit organizations. The recipient and the Grant Project Officer will       
  develop a process for jointly evaluating and reporting progress and               
  accomplishments under the work plan. The work plans and reporting must be         
  consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 30, Subpart C. A description of   
  the evaluation process and a reporting schedule must be included in the work      
  plan (see sections 30.51 through 30.53). The reporting schedule requires the      
  recipient to submit, at a minimum, annual progress reports, during the life of the
  project, to the Grant Project Officer. Recipients should provide discussion of    
  accomplishments as measured against work plan commitments; a discussion of        
  cumulative effectiveness of the work performed under all work plan                
  components; a discussion of existing and potential problem areas; and             
  suggestions for improvement, including where feasible, schedules for making       
  improvements. If evaluation reveals the recipient has not made sufficient         
  progress under the work plan, the Grant Project Officer and the recipient will    
  negotiate a resolution. The recipient may request a review of the Grant Project   
  Officer's decision under the dispute resolution process under (40 CFR 30.63).     
  Uniform reporting requirement for state, local and tribal governments. The        
  recipient and the Grant Project Officer will develop a process for jointly        
  evaluating and reporting progress and accomplishments under the work plan.        
  The work plans and reporting must be consistent with the requirements of 40       
  CFR 31, subpart C. A description of the evaluation process and a reporting        
  schedule must be included in the work plan (see sections 31.40 through 30.42).    
  The reporting schedule requires the recipient to submit, at a minimum, annual     
  progress reports, during the life of the project, to the Grant Project Officer.   
  Recipients should provide discussion of accomplishments as measured against       
  work plan commitments; a discussion of cumulative effectiveness of the work       
  performed under all work plan components; a discussion of existing and            
  potential problem areas; and suggestions for improvement, including where         
  feasible, schedules for making improvements. If evaluation reveals the recipient  
  has not made sufficient progress under the work plan, the Grant Project Officer   
  and the recipient will negotiate a resolution that addresses the issues. If issues
  cannot be resolved through negotiation, the Grant Project Officer may take        
  appropriate action (see sections 31.43 through 31.44.) The recipient may request  
  a review of the Grant Project Officer's decision under the dispute resolution     
  process under 40 CFR, Part 31, subpart F.                                         
Audits:                                                                             
  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the

  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,

  Organizations," non-federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that
  year. Non-federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.

  those raised as a result of an audit, related records should be retained until the
