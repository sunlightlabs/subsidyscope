  Installation of cost-share practices to develop wildlife habitat can be funded by   
  cost-sharing up to 75 percent of the total cost of establishing the conservation    
  practice by NRCS. Program participants or nonfederal partners provide the           
  remaining 25 percent. Other conservation practices may be required to be            
  installed without program payments.                                                 
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                                
  The WHIP cost-share agreement period is a minimum of 5 to 10 years.                 
  Agreements of shorter duration are permitted under limited wildlife emergency       
  circumstances. Obligations for assistance are tied to the schedule for applying     
  wildlife habitat conservation practices included in the Wildlife Habitat            
  Development Plan used as the basis for contract. Payments are made when the         
  participant and NRCS certify that a conservation practice is completed in           
  accordance with the cost-share agreement.

  No reports. NRCS will review contract implementation annually during the            
  length of the cost-share agreement that includes maintenance of completed           
  contract items and need for deletion or addition of cost-share agreement items.     
Audits:                                                                               
  NRCS makes periodic random reviews of the operation and maintenance of the

  States began implementing WHIP in fiscal year 1998. Over 3.7 million acres are      
  enrolled in the program. The average agreement encompassed 165 acres. Of all        
  acres enrolled, 95 percent are designed for upland habitat, 3 percent for wetland   
  habitat, 2 percent were riparian habitat, and nearly 1 percent in-stream aquatic    
  habitat. It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the total acreage enrolled
  in WHIP will benefit threatened and endangered species.
