EXAMPLES OF FUNDED PROJECTS:                                                         
  NRCS made a major effort to accelerate the work during fiscal year 2006. The       
  objective for NRCS and our local, State and federal partners is to finish all dead 
  tree removal work in the priority areas by the end of calendar year 2007. This     
  has been communicated to all our partners and plans are being put into place to    
  accomplish this goal. Alabama: Hurricane Recovery Efforts -- Alabama has been      
  very aggressively responding to municipalities and local units of government to    
  assist with repair of damages caused by recent hurricanes, Dennis and Katrina.     
  For traditional Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP) efforts,              
  Alabama received and approved requests from 34 sponsors for $18,893,975 to         
  address damages at 205 sites. The potential fire hazards resulting from downed     
  timber from hurricane damage needed to be addressed. For removal of downed         
  timber resulting from hurricane damage from Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina,         
  Alabama recently obligated $14.6 million dollars to implement emergency            
  measures to relieve imminent hazards to life and property. Alabama received        
  requests from 1,050 landowners to address damages on 295,114 acres. Priority       
  was given in areas with a high risk for wildfire and associated smoke concerns     
  near transportation corridors and fire concerns near urban interface areas. Five   
  counties designated as limited resource areas were assisted with the Program. In   
                                                                                     
  addition, the Poarch Band of Creek Indian Reservation has EWP contracts

                                                                                     
  totaling $779,000 to repair 16 hurricane-damaged sites. This is the first time the

                                                                                     
  tribe has participated in the EWP Program. Florida: Hurricane Recovery Efforts

                                                                                     
  -- Hurricane Charley - City of Punta Gorda: On October 24, 2005 Hurricane          
  Wilma hit Broward County. With over 2,000 miles of canals and waterways in         
  Broward County, most were damaged from debris and erosion. NRCS provided           
  financial and technical assistance to 31 local units of government to remove       
  debris from waterways and repair erosion damage to streambanks. Several sites      
  are completed with the remainder of the work in progress.Massachusetts:            
  Whittenton Pond Dam, Taunton -- NRCS used EWP funding to alleviate the             
  threat to public safety and property through a controlled draw-down of water due   
  to the high risk of dam failure due to flooding The wooden portion of the dam      
  was removed ass part of the draw-down and rock was used to stabilize the site to   
  stop further erosion. Without immediate action by NRCS the dam could have          
  failed flooding business and residences in Taunton. Massachusetts: Millpond        
  Dam, Rockport -- A dam in Rockport partially collapsed after heavy rain and        
  was in jeopardy of failing. NRCS immediately responded and place rock to           
  stabilize the dam until sponsors could inspect and determine the best course of    
  action to rebuild or remove the dam. Without NRCS action the dam could have        
  failed damaging water and sewer lines immediately downstream along with other      


                                                                               11-08 
  businesses and residences. Since the dam is in close proximity of Rockport
  Harbor rupture of the sewer line could have caused serious contamination.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PROPOSALS:
  EWP projects are eligible when they provide runoff retardation and soil erosion
  prevention, safeguard lives and property, and relieve an imminent threat that is a
  result of a sudden impairment in a watershed due to a natural disaster.
