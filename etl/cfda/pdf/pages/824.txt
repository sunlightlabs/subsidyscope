  apprentices are registered in 23 States. OA also provides technical assistance      
  and works closely with State Apprenticeship Councils/State Apprenticeship           
  Agencies (SACs/SAAs) in the remaining 27 States, the District of Columbia,          
  and three territories that register programs and apprentices in accordance with     
  Federal standards. OA provides information on existing and recommended              
  standards of training in registered apprenticeship as well as on other types of     
  industrial skill improvement programs. The wage rates of apprentices in             
  registered programs (Federal and State) are exempt from the prevailing wage         
  requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and the Service Contract Act. Registered        
  Apprenticeship is the combination of learning on-the-job and related technical      
  and theoretical instruction in a skilled occupation. Registered programs are        
  driven directly by the demands of the labor market. The training is industry-       
  driven, voluntarily sponsored by individual employers, employer associations,       
  and/or by joint employer-employee groups. OA brings these entities together, as     
  appropriate, to formulate registered apprenticeship training programs which         
  meet the federal standards. Various educational institutions and sponsors           
  provide theoretical and related instruction. Special efforts are being made to      
  introduce the apprenticeship concept of training into high-growth industries and    
  occupations. The Advisory Committee on Apprenticeship, representing                 
  employers, labor, vocational education, and others with an interest in skill        
  training, advises the Secretary of Labor on apprenticeship and training issues.     
  Special grants are provided to eligible organizations to assist employer and labor  
  unions in placement and retention of women in apprenticeship and                    
  nontraditional occupations.

  Employers,a group of employers, or an association of employers, or individual

Application Procedure:

  Prospective program sponsors must meet with an OA or SAC/SAA field                  
  representative, as appropriate, to draw up a set of apprenticeship training         
  program standards. These include the age and educational background of              
  apprentices, and a schedule of the work processes and related theoretical           
  instruction subjects to be covered during the training program. The program will    
  be registered if it meets Federal requirements covering (a) the apprenticeability   
  of the occupation(s) and (b) the suitability of the training standards for providing
  apprentices with sufficient knowledge to become skilled workers. Grants for         
  projects are awarded on a competitive basis, announced in Solicitation for Grant    
  Applications (SGAs) in the Federal Register and also on ETA's Internet website      
  at http://www.doleta.gov. To compete for a grant, organizations develop a           
  proposal and budget that demonstrate how the organization will provide services     
  to a targeted population. The SGA provides all of the necessary information for     
  applying for federal assistance.                                                    
                                                                                      
Award Procedure:

  Not applicable for advisory services and counseling type of assistance.             
  Procedures for grant projects are specified in the applicable request for

  composed of staff from ETA program offices as well as peer reviewers evaluates      
  eligible submitted applications. The panel prepares a report for the ETA Grant      
  Officer identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the application and the         
  cumulative rating. Once selections are made by the Grant Officer, an Award          
  Notification is sent through the appropriate congressional channels for             
  notification. After awardees are notified, the list of awardees is posted on the    
  ETA website at www.doleta.gov. If an application is rejected, a letter is sent to   
  the applicant as notification that they were not selected as a recipient of the     
  grant.
