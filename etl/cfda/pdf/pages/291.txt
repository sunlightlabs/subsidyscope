  In FY 06, base grant levels to State agencies totaled $16.2 million. Unspent      
  funds from FY 2006 were reallocated on a proportionate basis to participating     
  SFMNP grantees in the spring of 2007. In FY 2007, 46 State agencies and           
  federally recognized Indian tribal governments operated the SFMNP. In FY 06,      
  825,691 seniors were served by the SFMNP by 14,574 farmers at 2,911 markets,      
  2,323 roadside stands, and 260 community supported agriculture programs. In       
  December2006, FNS published a final rule for the SFMNP, which would make          
  the program a permanent nutrition assistance.
