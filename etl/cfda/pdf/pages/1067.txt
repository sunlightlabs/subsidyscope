64.106 SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING FOR DISABLED
VETERANS
   (Paraplegic Housing)
FEDERAL AGENCY:
  VETERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF
  VETERANS AFFAIRS
AUTHORIZATION:
  Public Laws 80-702, 96-385, 105-178, and 109-233; 38 U.S.C. 2101-2106.
OBJECTIVES:
  To help certain severely disabled veterans acquire a home which is suitably
  adapted to meet the special needs of their disabilities.
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:
  Direct Payments for Specified Use.
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  a. The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) program provides 50 percent of the
  cost to the veteran of the adapted house, land, and allowable expenses, not to
  exceed a maximum grant of $50,000. The money may be used to help (1)
  construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired
  by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or
  (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a
  suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. In computing the amount
  of the grant, the costs may include incidental expenses such as connections to
  public facilities and customary fees for the services of an attorney, architect,
  loan closing, etc. There are restrictions on the use of a grant; if a loan is
  necessary to supplement the grant, monthly loan payments and the cost of
  maintaining the property must bear a proper relation to the veteran's present and
  anticipated income. The housing unit must also be suitable for the veteran's
  special needs, and the veteran must acquire acceptable title to the property. b.
  The Special Housing Adaptations (SHA) program provides the actual cost to the
  veteran of certain adaptations and/or equipment, not to exceed a maximum grant
  of $10,000. The home to be adapted must be owned by the veteran or by a
  member of the veteran's family, and the veteran must intend to continue residing
  there. c. The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides
  adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to
  permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is
  otherwise eligible for SAH, the assistance is limited to $14,000. If a veteran is
  otherwise eligible for SHA, the assistance is limited to $2,000. d. SAH and
  SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant
  amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be
  used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the
  amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available
  statutory maximum.
Applicant Eligibility:
  For a SAH grant, veterans are eligible if they are entitled to compensation under
  chapter 11 for a permanent, total, and service-connected disability due to: (1)
  loss or loss of use of both lower extremities, such as to preclude locomotion
  without the aid of braces, canes, crutches, or a wheelchair; (2) blindness in both
  eyes, having only light perception, plus loss or loss of use of one lower
  extremity; (3) loss or loss of use of one lower extremity, together with residuals
  of organic disease or injury, or the loss or loss of use of one upper extremity,
  which so affect the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude locomotion
  without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair; or (4) loss or loss of
  use, of both upper extremities such as to preclude use of the arms at or above the
  elbows. It must be medically feasible for the veteran to reside in the particular
  home involved. For a SHA grant, veterans are eligible if they are entitled to
  compensation under chapter 11 for a permanent and total service-connected
  disability that (1) is due to blindness in both eyes with 5/200 visual acuity or
  less, or (2) includes the anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands.
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  Permanently and totally disabled veterans.
Credentials/Documentation:
  None.
Preapplication Coordination:
  None. This program is excluded from coverage under E.O. 12372.
