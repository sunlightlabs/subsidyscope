  The major elements in evaluating proposals include assessments of: (1)
  Significance: Does this study address an important problem? If the aims of the
  application are achieved, how will scientific knowledge or clinical practice be
  advanced? What will be the effect of these studies on the concepts, methods,
  technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this
  field? (2) Approach: Are the conceptual or clinical framework, design,
  methods, and analyses adequately developed, well integrated, well reasoned, and
  appropriate to the aims of the project? Does the applicant acknowledge potential
  problem areas and consider alternative tactics? (3) Innovation: Is the project
  original and innovative? For example: Does the project challenge existing
  paradigms or clinical practice; address an innovative hypothesis or critical
  barrier to progress in the field? Does the project develop or employ novel
  concepts, approaches, methodologies, tools, or technologies for this area? (4)
  Investigators: Are the investigators appropriately trained and well suited to carry
  out this work? Is the work proposed appropriate to the experience level of the
  principal investigator and other researchers? Does the investigative team bring
  complementary and integrated expertise to the project (if applicable)? (5)
  Environment: Does the scientific environment in which the work will be done
  contribute to the probability of success? Do the proposed studies benefit from
  unique features of the scientific environment, or subject populations, or employ
  useful collaborative arrangements? Is there evidence of institutional support?
