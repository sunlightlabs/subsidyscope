Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:                                                   
  Approximately 180 days.                                                             
Appeals:                                                                              
  Assistance agreement competition-related disputes will be resolved in               
  accordance with the dispute resolution procedures published in 70 FR (Federal       
  Register) 3629, 3630 (January 26, 2005). Copies of these procedures may also        
  be requested by contacting the individual(s) listed as "Information Contacts."      
  Disputes relating to matters other than the competitive selection of recipients     
  will be resolved under 40 CFR 30.63 or 40 CFR 31.70, as applicable.                 
Renewals:                                                                             
  None. A standard grant application should be prepared and submitted as a new        
  grant, which will be reviewed in the same manner as the original application and    
  will compete for available funds. Generally, EPA incrementally funds grants and     
  cooperative agreements for surveys, studies, and investigations. Approval of        
  subsequent funding increments is dependent on satisfactory project progress,        
  continued relevance of the project to EPA's priorities, and availability of funds.  
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                    
  Not applicable.                                                                     
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                                
  Grants and cooperative agreements are normally funded on a 12-month basis           
  (annual). Most of OEJ awarded grants and cooperative agreements have project        
  periods ranging from one year to five years, and generally, grants and              
  cooperative agreements are fully funded at the time of award.                       
Reports:                                                                              
  EPA includes reporting requirements for grants and cooperative agreements in        
  the terms and conditions of the agreements. Agreements may require quarterly,       
  interim, and final progress reports, and financial, equipment, and invention        
  reports. Reporting requirements are also identified in the Grant Regulations Part   


928                                                                             11-08

Audits:
  Grants and cooperative agreements are subject to inspections and audits by the
  Comptroller General of the United States, the EPA Office of Inspector General,

  year. In accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133 (Revised,

  Organizations," nonfederal entities that expend $500,000 or more in a year in
  Federal awards shall have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that
  year. Nonfederal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal
  awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted
  in OMB Circular No. A-133.
Records:
  Recipients must keep financial records, including all documents supporting
  entries on accounting records and to substantiate changes in grants available to
  personnel authorized to examine EPA recipients grants and cooperative
  agreements records. Recipients must maintain all records until 3 years from the
  date of submission of final expenditure reports. If questions, such as those raised
  as a result of audits remain following the 3-year period, recipients must retain
  records until the matter is completely resolved.
