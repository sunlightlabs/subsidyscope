  The results and accomplishments from basic and applied research and                  
  development performed under these grants are reported in the open scientific         
  literature. University research may be integrated with ongoing research and          
  development programs at the DOE national laboratories which will facilitate          
  access to and use of special facilities and equipment. The objective of these        
  grants is to advance the state of knowledge on science and technology. The final     
  product may lead to improved or new commercial products to ensure availability       
  to the U.S. arms control and nonproliferation community. It is expected that less    
  than 20 grants will be awarded per year.
