  To assist State health departments in developing a State-based surveillance       
  system for monitoring hazardous substance emergency events. This surveillance     
  system will allow the State health department to better understand the public     
  health impact of hazardous substance emergencies by developing, implementing,     
  and evaluating a State-based surveillance system.                                 
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:

  The participant State health agencies will use the information collected to assess
  the burden of adverse health effects created by these unexpected, sudden releases 
  of hazardous substances, describe the situations and persons most likely          
  impacted, define the risk factors for adverse health effects, and work with other 
  agencies to implement prevention activities. Funds may be expended for            
  reasonable program purposes, such as personnel, travel, supplies, and services.   
  Equipment may be purchased with cooperative agreement funds; however,             
  justification must be provided which should include a cost comparison of          
  purchase versus lease options. All purchased equipment must be compatible         
  with ATSDR's equipment and shall be returned to ATSDR at the completion of        
  the project.
