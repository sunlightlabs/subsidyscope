  The program currently receives on average 20,000 new lost time injury claims        
  per year from longshore and harbor workers, District of Columbia workers in         
  private industry, and specified other workers covered by extensions of the Act,     
  or their survivors. While most cases are paid directly by the injured worker's      
  employer or insurance carrier, the program is responsible for initially             
  adjudicating disputed claims for benefits and ensuring that injured workers and     
  their survivors receive the benefits to which they are entitled in a timely manner.

  To provide standards protecting wages of working persons by requiring a             
  minimum hourly wage rate and overtime pay, or prevailing hourly wage rates,         
  fringe benefits and overtime pay under the Government Contract Acts.                
  Additional standards apply to child labor, to wage payment standards for            
  professional performers and related or supporting professional employees of         
  productions assisted by grants from the National Endowments for the Arts and        
  Humanities, to curtail employer use of lie detector tests, including polygraph      
  tests, for pre-employment screening or during the course of employment and to       
  enforce contractual obligations regarding wages and other working conditions        
  between certain temporary, alien agricultural workers (H-2A) and their              
  employers, to enforce worker protection provisions applicable to nonimmigrant       
  workers in "specialty occupations" (H-1B) and foreign crew members                  
  performing longshore work, and to require private employers with 50 or more         
  employees and all schools and public employers to provide eligible employees        
  up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, job restoration, and continued employer             
  provided health insurance due to the employee's serious health condition, the

TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:

USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:
  Federal wage and hour standards apply generally to employees engaged in
  interstate or foreign commerce or in the production of goods for such commerce
  or in enterprises so engaged and, in addition, to employees of Federal, State and
  local governments, hospitals, businesses providing medical or nursing care for
  residents, schools and preschools. Generally, for covered employment the
  minimum hourly wage is $5.15 per hour (effective September 1, 1997) with time
  and one-half the regular rate of pay required for hours worked over 40 in a
  workweek. There are special rules applicable to employees of State and local
  governments, including provisions concerning volunteer work, compensatory
  time-off, and outside employment. To the extent necessary to prevent
  curtailment of employment opportunity, certificates authorizing special
  minimum wage rates are issued for learners, workers with disabilities, full-time
  students, student workers, and apprentices. In nonagricultural employment, the
  basic minimum age is 16 years for general employment, 14 for work outside
  school hours in certain occupations under specified conditions, and 18 in
  occupations found hazardous by the Secretary. In agricultural employment, the
  basic minimum age is 16 years during school hours and in occupations found
  hazardous by the Secretary; otherwise, age 14 for work outside school hours
  except for 12- and 13-year-olds with written parental consent or on farms where
  their parents are employed, or under age 12 with written parental consent on a
  farm not subject to Federal minimum wage or under a limited waiver for local
  10- and 11-year-old hand-harvesters of short-season crops under specified
  conditions. Failure to comply with the child labor provisions of the Fair Labor
  Standards Act or regulations issued there under may result in an assessment of a
  civil money penalty not to exceed $11,000 for each minor involved in violations.
  Employees of contractors performing on most federally financed or assisted
  construction projects, or providing services under contract to Federal agencies,
  are subject to special standards. These special standards require that employees
  receive no less than the wages and fringe benefits prevailing in the locality as
  determined by the Secretary of Labor, and that overtime compensation, with few
  exceptions, be paid for hours worked on such contracts in excess of 40 in a
  week. The standards apply to performance on direct Federal contracts and also to
  most construction projects financed in whole or in part by the Federal
  Government (e.g., projects under the National Housing Act). Under current law,
  for Federal and federally assisted construction contracts over $2,000 and Federal
  service contracts over $2,500 subject to prevailing wage requirements,
  contracting agencies must obtain a wage determination issued by the Wage and
  Hour Division. Also under current law, employees working on Federal contracts
  in excess of $10,000 calling for the manufacture or furnishing of supplies are
  required to be paid not less than the Federal minimum wage and overtime pay
  for hours worked in excess of 40 a week. Labor standards are set under the Arts
  and Humanities Act which require the payment of the prevailing minimum
  compensation as determined by the Secretary of Labor to professional
  performers or supporting personnel who work on projects or productions assisted
  by grants from the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. The
  Employee Polygraph Protection Act prohibits most private employers from
  administering lie detector tests to employees or prospective employees but
  permits the use of polygraph tests under certain conditions. The H-2A
  provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act provide for the enforcement
  of contractual obligations concerning wages and other working conditions
  between certain temporary, alien agricultural workers and their employers.
  Section 203 of the Immigration Act of
  1990placeslimitations on the performance of Longshore work by alien crew
  members in U.S. ports; Section 212(n)places limitations on the employment of
  nonimmigrant workers in H-1B Specialty Occupations. The Family and
  Medical Leave Act requires a private employer of 50 or more employees and all
  public employers and schools to grant up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a 12-
  month period to any employee who was employed at least 12 months for 1,250
  hours of service during the preceding 12 months, and is employed at a work site
  where there are 50 employees within 75 miles.
Applicant Eligibility:
  Any covered employee, unless specifically exempt, is entitled to be paid in
  accordance with applicable monetary standards in the United States, District of
  Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Wake Island,
  Johnston Island, and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands defined in the Outer
  Continental Shelf Lands Act. (Geographic application varies under the
  respective statutes and eligibility is dependent upon specific statutory language.)
   For family and medical leave, coverage includes any employer with 50 or more
  employees but excludes any employer at a worksite with fewer than 50
  employees within a 75-mile radius.
Beneficiary Eligibility:
  Employees.
