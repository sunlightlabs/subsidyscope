  Funded projects are cooperative agreements to State governments to develop,         
  implement, and maintain an emergency event surveillance system. All projects        
  have as their overall objectives: A. Describe the type and cause of morbidity       
  experienced by employees, first responders and the general public as a result of    
  selected hazardous substance emergencies; B. Develop and propose strategies to      
  reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality when comparable events occur in the       
  future; C. Evaluate the public health impact of hazardous material releases,        
  expand the access to databases with relevant hazardous material events and          
  provide annual summaries of public health impacts; and D. Continue formal and       
  informal interactions with State programs and local emergency responders, as        
  well as private industry, to yield new resources and more complete information      
  on emergency events.
