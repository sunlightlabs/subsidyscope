Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                     
  Public Law 107-288, signed on November 7, 2002 amended 38 U.S.C. and

  changed the grants to States for this functional staffing grant to a fiscal formula  
  grant to support staffing. Therefore, there is no longer a formula staff level to be 
  assigned to a State based on the number of veterans registering for employment       
  services. Instead, a new funding distribution formula was developed. The             
  relative allocation of funding to States is developed based on a combination of      
  the ratio of the general unemployment level in each State compared with the          
  unemployment level in all States using Local Area Unemployment Statistics            
  (LAUS) data and the ratio of the number of veterans in the civilian labor force in   
  the State as compared to the number of veterans in the civilian labor force in all   
  states using the Current Population Survey CPS) data. This methodology uses          
  data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. No matching is required.            
Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:                                                 
  Usually awarded for a fiscal year (October through September). States may            
  obligate funds to provide assistance for a fifth fiscal year quarter (until          
  December 31).
