  to domestic small business concerns (entities that are independently owned and    
  operated for profit, are not dominant in the field in which research is proposed  
  and have no more than 500 employees) which "partner" with a research              
  institution in cooperative research and development. At least 40 percent of the   
  project is to be performed by the small business concern and at least 30 percent  
  by the research institution. In both Phase I and Phase II, the research must be   
  performed in the U.S. and its possessions. To be eligible for funding, a grant    
  application must be approved for scientific merit and program relevance by a      
  scientific review group and a national advisory council.                          
Beneficiary Eligibility:

  Regulations 45 CFR, Part 74, Subpart Q. For SBIR and STTR grants, applicant       
  organization (small business concern) must present in a research plan an idea     
  that has potential for commercialization and furnish evidence that scientific     
  competence, experimental methods, facilities, equipment, and funds requested      
  are appropriate to carry out the plan. Grant forms PHS 6246-1 and PHS 6246-2      
  are used to apply for SBIR Phase I and Phase II, respectively. Grant forms PHS    
  6246-3 and PHS 6246-4 are used to apply for STTR Phase I and Phase II,

  Grants and cooperative agreements are funded based on scientific merit,           
  program relevance, and program balance and are made annually. Initial award       
  provides funds for first budget period (usually 12 months) and Notice of Grant    
  Award (Form PHS 1533) indicates support recommended for remainder of              
  project period, allocation of Federal funds by budget categories, and special     
  conditions, if any. All accepted SBIR/STTR applications are evaluated for         
  scientific and technical merit by an appropriate scientific peer review panel and 
  by a national advisory council or board. All applications receiving a priority    
  score compete for available SBIR/STTR set-aside funds on the basis of scientific  
  and technical merit and commercial potential of the proposed research, program    
  relevance, and program balance among the areas of research.
