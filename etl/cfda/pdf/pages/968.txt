OBJECTIVES:                                                                           
  To provide for education, technical assistance and enforcement of the Federal       
  prohibition against employment discrimination in the private and public sector      
  based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.                            
TYPES OF ASSISTANCE:                                                                  
  Advisory Services and Counseling; Investigation of Complaints.                      
USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:                                                            
  Individuals are protected from discrimination on the basis of race, color,          
  religion, sex and national origin by employers with 15 or more employees, by        
  Federal, state, and local governments, by employment agencies, and by labor         
  organizations. Charges of discrimiinatory employment practices by or on behalf      
  of an individual or group of iindividuals claiming to be aggrieved are received.    
  Mediation of the dispute may be offered. If mediation is not used or is not         
  successful, investigations ensue. If reasonable cause is not found, the             
  Commission issues a right to sue letter. If reasonable cause is found, the charge   
  is conciliated. If conciliation proves to be unsuccessful and the employer is not   
  a State or local government, the Commission may bring a civil action against        
  respondent(s) named in the charge or issue a right to sue letter. If conciliation   
  fails on a charge against a State or local goverment, EEOC refers the case to the   
  Department of Justice for consideration of litigation or issuance of a right to sue 
  letter.

Award Procedure:                                                                      
  A charge is sufficient when the Commission receives from the person making          
  the charge a written statement sufficiently precise to identify the parties and to  
  describe generally the action or practices complained of.                           
Deadlines:                                                                            
  Individuals with complaints or desiring to bring their own suit under Title VII     
  must file a charge of discrimination alleging discrimination with the EEOC          
  within 180 days of the alleged unlawful practice (or within 300 days if there is a  
  State or local agency with its own discrimination law and authority to grant        
  relief). When EEOC completes its investigation without obtaining relief for         
  persons covered by a charge, covered persons will be given written notice of        
  their right to sue. Persons can also request a notice of right to sue before EEOC   
  finishes its investigation after the charge has been on file 180 days. When a right 
  to sue is issued on request, EEOC usually stops investigating. Suit must be         
  brought within 90 days of receipt of the notice of right to sue.
