Range of Approval/Disapproval Time:

  A State board that is dissatisfied with the final action of the Assistant Secretary 
  in disapproving a State plan is afforded reasonable notice and opportunity for a    
  hearing.                                                                            
Renewals:                                                                             
  None.                                                                               
Formula and Matching Requirements:                                                    
  The funding formula is based on State per-capita income and population in three     
  age cohorts (15-19, 20-24, and 25-65). The formula provides for a minimum           
  State allocation of at least 0.5 percent of the total, and a "hold-harmless"        
  provision in the formula ensures that no State's share of the appropriation is less 
  than its share of the fiscal year 1998 appropriation. A special provision limits    
  the increase a State with an initial allocation of the 0.5 percent minimum may      
  receive, resulting in a number of States that receive an allocation of less than 0.5
  percent of the total. If appropriations result in the amount of funds for allocation
  to States exceeding the amount of funds allocated to States from the FY 2006        
  appropriation, up to one-third of the additional funds are allotted to States with  
  FY 2006 grants that are less than the minimum 0.5 percent grant amount and the      
  remainder would flow to the other States. In addition, the Pacific territories      
  receive 0.13 percent of the total appropriated for State Grants to operate the      
  same kinds of career and technical education programs as the States. Also, 1.25     
  percent of the total appropriation for State Grants is set aside for grants to      
  federally recognized Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and 0.25 percent is    
  set aside for competitive grants to organizations that primarily serve and          
  represent Hawaiian Natives. The Bureau of the Census supplies the population        
  data; the Department of Labor supplies the per capita income data.
