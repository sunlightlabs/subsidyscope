#,Exclusion of benefits and allowances to armed forces personnel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Benefits and allowances to Armed Forces personnel.&mdash;Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. As an example, a rental voucher of $100 is (approximately) equal in value to $100 of cash income. In contrast to this treatment, certain housing and meals, in addition to other benefits provided military personnel, either in cash or in kind, as well as certain amounts of pay related to combat service, are excluded from income subject to tax International Affairs. </p>"
