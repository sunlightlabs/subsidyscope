##,Individual Retirement Accounts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).&mdash; Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including deferred and dedicated payments, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, under current law individual taxpayers can take advantage of several different IRAs to defer or otherwise reduce the tax on the return to their retirement savings. These arrangements include deductible IRAs, nondeductible IRAs and Roth IRAs. The IRA contribution limit is $5,000 in 2009 (indexed thereafter) and allows taxpayers over age 50 to make additional ""catch-up'' contributions of $1,000. Taxpayers can make a deductible IRA contribution only up to certain levels of AGI depending on whether they are active participants in employer plans. Above those AGI limits, the amount that may be deducted is reduced and eventually phased out. There is no income limit for nondeductible IRA contributions, which still benefit from deferral of tax on earnings. Roth IRA contributions are not deductible, but earnings and withdrawals are exempt from taxation under certain conditions. AGI limits also apply to Roth IRA contributions. </p>"

##,Special ESOP rules,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Employer Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) provisions.&mdash;ESOPs are a special type of tax-exempt employee benefit plan. Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, employer-paid contributions (the value of stock issued to the ESOP) are deductible by the employer as part of employee compensation costs. They are not included in the employees' gross income for tax purposes, however, until they are paid out as benefits. The following special income tax provisions for ESOPs are intended to increase ownership of corporations by their employees: (1) annual employer contributions are subject to less restrictive limitations; (2) ESOPs may borrow to purchase employer stock, guaranteed by their agreement with the employer that the debt will be serviced by his payment (deductible by him) of a portion of wages (excludable by the employees) to service the loan; (3) employees who sell appreciated company stock to the ESOP may defer any taxes due until they withdraw benefits; and (4) dividends paid to ESOP-held stock are deductible by the employer. </p>"

Under current law, however, individuals who are 65 years of age or older, or who are permanently disabled, can take a tax credit equal to 15 percent of the sum of their earned and retirement income. Income is limited to no more than $5,000 for single individuals or married couples filing a joint return where only one spouse is 65 years of age or older, and up to $7,500 for joint returns where both spouses are 65 years of age or older. These limits are reduced by one-half of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income over $7,500 for single individuals and $10,000 for married couples filing a joint return. </p>"

For a family with one qualifying child, the credit is 34 percent of the first $8,950 of earned income in 2009. The credit is 40 percent of the first $12,570 of income for a family with two or more qualifying children. The credit is 45 percent of the first $12,570 of income for a family with three or more qualifying children. Low-income workers with no qualifying children are eligible for a 7.65 percent credit on the first $5,970 of earned income. The credit is phased out at income levels and rates which depend upon how many qualifying children are eligible and marital status. Earned income tax credits in excess of tax liabilities owed through the individual income tax system are refundable to individuals. </p>"
