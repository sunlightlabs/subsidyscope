"#","Adoption credit and exclusion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities. Instead, taxpayers can receive a refundable tax credit for qualified adoption expenses under current law. The maximum credit is $13,170 per child for 2010, and is phased-out ratably for taxpayers with modified AGI between $182,520 and $222,520. The credit amounts and the phase-out thresholds are indexed for inflation. Taxpayers may also exclude qualified adoption expenses from income, subject to the same maximum amounts and phase-out as the credit. The same expenses cannot qualify for tax benefits under both programs; however, a taxpayer may use the benefits of the exclusion and the tax credit for different expenses. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

<p>Employer contributions to VEBAs are deductible within limits, while employee contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

Similarly, tuition reductions for employees of educational institutions and their families are not included in taxable income. From an economic point of view, scholarships and fellowships are either gifts not conditioned on the performance of services, or they are rebates of educational costs. Thus, under the baseline tax system of the reference law method, this exclusion is not a tax expenditure because this method does not include either gifts or price reductions in a taxpayer's gross income. The exclusion, however, is considered a tax expenditure under the normal tax method, which includes gift-like transfers of Government funds in gross income (many scholarships are derived directly or indirectly from Government funding). </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

The latter enable payments to be made on behalf of beneficiaries into a variety of investment vehicles offered by plan sponsors (e.g., age-based portfolios whose mix of stocks and bonds changes the closer the beneficiary's matriculation date or an option with a guaranteed rate of return); the balances in college savings accounts can be applied toward a panoply of qualified higher education expenses (e.g., tuition and fees, books, supplies, room and board, and special needs services).

"#","Work opportunity tax credit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code provides employers with a tax credit for qualified wages paid to individuals. The credit applies to employees who begin work on or before August 31, 2011 and who are certified as members of various targeted groups. The amount of the credit that can be claimed is 25 percent of qualified wages for employment less than 400 hours and 40 percent for employment of 400 hours or more. Generally, the maximum credit per employee is $2,400 and can only be claimed on the first year of wages an individual earns from an employer. However, the credit for long-term welfare recipients can be claimed on second year wages as well and has a $9,000 maximum. Employees must work at least 120 hours to be eligible for the credit. Employers must reduce their deduction for wages paid by the amount of the credit claimed. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"
