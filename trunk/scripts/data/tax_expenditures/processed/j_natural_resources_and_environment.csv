Over the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost of the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion offers more generous tax treatment than would cost depletion, which would limit deductions to an investment's cost. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

Generally, governments and nonprofit entities would issue the bonds and use the bond proceeds to buy forest land. The FCBs are intended to encourage the purchase and conservation of forest land by governments and nonprofit entities.</p>

<p>Once the bonds are issued, the proceeds must be spent within three years. A unique feature of FCBs is the allowance for an issuer to characterize up to 50 percent of its allocation amount as though it had been a federal tax payment for the previous year. The legislation then provides that the Treasury cannot collect these payments from such entities. Thus, the Treasury is then required to ""refund"" the phantom tax payment (i.e., up to 50 percent of the bond allocation) to the allocatee. This forms the basis of the revenue loss amount for this tax expenditure.<p>

"#","Special tax rate for nuclear decommissioning reserve funds",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Taxpayers who are responsible for the costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants (e.g., utilities) can elect to create reserve funds to be used to pay for decommissioning. The funds receive special tax treatment: amounts contributed to a reserve fund are deductible in the year made and are not included in the taxpayer's gross income until the year they are distributed, thus effectively postponing tax on the contributed amounts. Amounts actually spent on decommissioning are deductible in the year they are made. The fund's investments, however, are subject to a 20 percent tax rate--a lower rate than that which applies to most other corporate income.</p>","Description adapted from <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-111SPRT62799/pdf/CPRT-111SPRT62799.pdf""><em>Tax Expenditures: Compendium of Background Materials on Individual Provisions</em></a>, Congressional Research Service, December 2010, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office."

"#","Treatment of income from exploration and mining of natural resources as qualifying income under the publicly-traded partnership rules",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Code Sec. 7704, with a noteworthy exception, generally treats a publicly traded partnership (PTP) as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. For this purpose, a PTP is any partnership that is traded on an established securities market or secondary market. A notable exception to Sec. 7704 occurs if 90 percent of the gross income of a PTP is passive-type income, such as interest, dividends, real property rents, gains from the disposition of real property, and similar income or gains. In these cases, the PTP is exempt from corporate level taxation, thus allowing it to claim pass-through status for tax purposes.</p>

<p>Qualifying income includes interest, dividends, real property rents, gain from the disposition of real property, income and gains from certain natural resource activities, gain from the disposition of a capital asset (e.g., selling stock), or certain property held for the production of income, as well as certain income and gains from commodities. In addition, income derived from the exploration, development, mining or production, processing, refining, transportation, or the marketing of any mineral or natural resource are treated as qualifying income for publicly traded partnerships.</p>
