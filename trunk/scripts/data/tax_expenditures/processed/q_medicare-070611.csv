,"Medicare",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The 'Medicare' budget function includes government spending on the Medicare program, which provides health insurance to senior citizens and persons with disabilities. This budget function does not include funding for Medicaid.  'Medicare' is function 570 of the U.S. Budget. ",
"#","Exclusion of certain subsidies to employers who maintain prescription drug plans for Medicare enrollees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>The Medicare program has four components: Parts A , B, C, and D. Part D offers a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit that began on January 1, 2006. Every individual enrolled in Medicare Parts A or B, or who receives Medicare benefits through a private health plan under Part C, is eligible to enroll in a qualified prescription drug plan. Federal subsidies are available to encourage widespread participation by low-income Medicare beneficiaries, and to prevent large numbers of public and private employers and unions that offer prescription drug benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees from dropping or sharply cutting this coverage. Public and private employers and unions electing the subsidy payments must agree to subject their drug benefits for retirees to continuing federal scrutiny. </p>
<p>In 2010 and 2011, the subsidy payments are equal to 28 percent of a qualified retiree's allowable gross prescription drug costs between $310 and $6,300. This means that the maximum subsidy for a qualified retiree in each year is $1,764. Employers who choose to receive subsidy payments are allowed to exclude them from their taxable income under both the regular income tax and the alternative minimum tax. In addition, an employer may disregard any subsidy it receives in calculating its deduction for health benefits for current employees and retirees. For tax years starting on or after January 1, 2013, employers will be required to reduce that deduction by the amount of any subsidy received, subjecting the subsidy to taxation.

"#","Exclusion of Medicare benefits: Hospital insurance (Part A)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>The Medicare program has four main components: Parts A, B, C, and D. Part A offers hospital insurance (HI). It covers most of the cost of in-patient hospital care and as much as 100 days a year of skilled nursing facility care, home health care, and hospice care for individuals who are age 65 and over or disabled. </p>

<p>Medicare Part A is financed primarily by a payroll tax levied on the earnings of current workers. The tax rate is 2.90 percent, and there is no ceiling on the earnings subject to the tax. Self-employed individuals pay the full rate, while employees and employers each pay 1.45 percent. The employer's share of the payroll tax is excluded from an employee's taxable income. Moreover, the expected lifetime value of Part A benefits under current law exceeds the amount of payroll tax contributions by current beneficiaries. These excess benefits are excluded from the taxable income of Medicare Part A beneficiaries.</p>

Part D provides an outpatient prescription drug benefit, which went into effect on January 1, 2006. The benefit is offered through stand-alone private prescription drug plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, such as health maintenance organizations, that provide all Medicare benefits, including coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike other Medicare services, Medicare beneficiaries can obtain the drug benefit only by enrolling in one of those plans, which are open to anyone entitled to Medicare Part A and/or enrolled in Medicare Part B.</p>

<p>Funding for Part D comes from a combination of enrollee premiums, state contributions (through the so-called ""clawback provision""), and general federal revenues. In keeping with the tax treatment of benefits received by beneficiaries under Parts A and B of Medicare, transfers from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury and state governments to pay for the cost of the drug benefit not covered by premiums are excluded from the taxable income of enrollees.</p>

The program generally pays for 80 percent of Medicare's fee schedule or other approved amounts after a beneficiary satisfies an annual deductible, which is $155 in 2010. Premiums are set to cover 25 percent of the program's estimated costs for most recipients; the remaining 75 percent is funded out of general revenues.
