For the 2004 through 2011 tax years taxpayers chose between deducting sales or income taxes; absent further action the sales tax deduction option will expire. The sales tax deduction option will likely be extended at least through 2010. There was also a temporary additional standard deduction for state and local sales and excise taxes paid on up to $49,500 of the purchase price of a qualified new car, light truck, motor home or motorcycle. The deduction was available for purchases made between February 16, 2009 and January 1, 2010. </p>","Description adapted from <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-111SPRT62799/pdf/CPRT-111SPRT62799.pdf""><em>Tax Expenditures: Compendium of Background Materials on Individual Provisions</em></a>, Congressional Research Service, December 2010, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office."
