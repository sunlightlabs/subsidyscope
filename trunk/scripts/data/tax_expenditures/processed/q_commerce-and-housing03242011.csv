It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Consumers and nonprofit organizations pay for some deposit-linked services, such as check cashing, by accepting a below-market interest rate on their demand deposits. If they received a market rate of interest on those deposits and paid explicit fees for the associated services, they would pay taxes on the full market rate and (unlike businesses) could not deduct the fees. The Government thus foregoes tax on the difference between the risk-free market interest rate and below-market interest rates on demand deposits, which under competitive conditions should equal the value added of deposit services. </p>",

"#","Interest rate and discounting period assumptions for reserves of property and casualty insurance companies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>The way in which the present values of future losses for property and casualty insurance companies are calculated may provide those insurers with a tax advantage. A present value is the current equivalent value of a given cash flow and is calculated using interest rates or discount factors and information about the timing of income and losses. Most businesses calculate taxable income by deducting expenses when the business becomes liable for paying them. A significant portion of losses paid by property and casualty insurance companies are paid years after premiums were collected. Funds that an insurer holds between payment of premiums and disbursement of loss claims are known as “float” and investment earnings on those funds are an important source of revenue in some lines of insurance.</p>

<p>State regulators typically require insurers to maintain minimum levels of loss reserves to ensure solvency, that is, the ability to pay all future claims. On the other hand, if loss reserves are well above levels needed to ensure solvency, an insurer may be able to shift current earnings into future years, thus deferring tax payments. In other words, some form of discounting is appropriate to ensure that premium income, received when a policy is written, is properly matched with associated losses that occur later. If losses in future years are not fully discounted, the insurer may enjoy a tax advantage through the ability to defer loss payments. </p>

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) imposed the 15 percent pro-ration provision, as Congress held that using tax-exempt investments to finance additions to loss reserves was “inappropriate.” Therefore, the allowable deduction for additions to loss reserves was reduced to 15 percent of (I) the insurer’s tax-exempt interest, (ii) the deductible portion of dividends received (with special rules for dividends from affiliates), and (iii) the increase for the taxable year in the cash value of life insurance, endowment or annuity contracts.</p>","Description adapted from <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-111SPRT62799/pdf/CPRT-111SPRT62799.pdf""><em>Tax Expenditures: Compendium of Background Materials on Individual Provisions</em></a>, Congressional Research Service, December 2010, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office."

Second, eligible companies may take a special deduction of 25 percent of the year’s health-related claims and expenses minus its accumulated surplus at the beginning of the year (if such claims and expenses exceed the accumulated surplus). The special deduction is also known as the “three-month” deduction because when an eligible insurer’s health-related claims and expenses exceed its accumulated surplus, it may deduct a quarter of the difference for the year. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the Treasury tax expenditure “Special Blue Cross/Blue Shield deduction,"" found in the Health Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>

Passive activities generally are defined as those in which the taxpayer does not materially participate and there are numerous additional considerations brought to bear on the determination of which activities are passive for a given taxpayer. Losses are limited in an attempt to limit tax sheltering activities.
