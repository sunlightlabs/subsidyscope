"#","Individual Retirement Accounts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p> Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including deferred and dedicated payments, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, under current law individual taxpayers can take advantage of traditional and Roth IRAs to defer or otherwise reduce the tax on the return to their retirement savings. The IRA contribution limit is $5,000 in 2010 (indexed); taxpayers age 50 or over are allowed to make additional ""catch-up'' contributions of $1,000. Contributions to a traditional IRA are generally deductible but the deduction is phased out for workers with incomes above certain levels who, or whose spouses, are active participants in an employer-provided retirement plan. Contributions and account earnings are includible in income when withdrawn from traditional IRAs. Individuals who make nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA can still benefit from deferral of tax on earnings. Roth IRA contributions are not deductible, but earnings and withdrawals are exempt from taxation under certain conditions. Income limits also apply to Roth IRA contributions; however, taxpayers at any income level may roll account balances from traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs, after paying income tax on any deduction and accrued income. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"
