"#","Apportionment of research and development expenses for determination of foreign tax credits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>The federal government taxes firms incorporated in the U.S. on their worldwide income but taxes foreign-based firms on their U.S. income only. When a U.S. firm earns foreign income through a foreign subsidiary, U.S. taxes apply to that income only when it is repatriated to the U.S. parent firm in the form of dividends, royalties, or other income; the foreign income is exempt from U.S. taxation as long as it remains in the control of the foreign subsidiary.</p>
<p>When the foreign-source income is repatriated, the U.S. parent corporation can claim a credit against its U.S. tax liability for any foreign taxes the subsidiary has paid on that income. The credit cannot exceed the U.S. tax due on the foreign-source income. It is intended to avoid double taxation of repatriated foreign income.</p>","Description adapted from <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-111SPRT62799/pdf/CPRT-111SPRT62799.pdf""><em>Tax Expenditures: Compendium of Background Materials on Individual Provisions</em></a>, Congressional Research Service, December 2010, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office."

In general, the credit is more advantageous than the deduction, because a credit reduces taxes paid on a dollar-for-dollar basis, while a deduction only reduces income subject to tax. However, in cases where the taxpayer is facing the foreign tax credit limit claiming the deduction will result in a lower tax liability.</p>","Description adapted from <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-111SPRT62799/pdf/CPRT-111SPRT62799.pdf""><em>Tax Expenditures: Compendium of Background Materials on Individual Provisions</em></a>, Congressional Research Service, December 2010, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office."

In contrast, certain active income of foreign corporations controlled by U.S. shareholders is not subject to U.S. taxation when it is earned. The income becomes taxable only when the controlling U.S. shareholders receive dividends or other distributions from their foreign stockholding. The reference law tax baseline reflects this tax treatment where only realized income is taxed. Under the normal tax method, however, the currently attributable foreign source pre-tax income from such a controlling interest is considered to be subject to U.S. taxation, whether or not distributed. Thus, the normal tax method considers the amount of controlled foreign corporation income not yet distributed to a U.S. shareholder as tax-deferred income. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

The parent company pays the IC-DISC a tax deductible commission attributable to qualified export sales. Because the IC-DISC pays no tax, distributions (actual or ""deemed"") to IC-DISC shareholders are taxed only once, often at the lower individual dividend and capital gains tax rates. As a result, the after tax return to shareholders is enhanced.</p>

<p>IC-DISC shareholders may defer up to $10 million that is attributable to qualified export sales. An interest charge is imposed on shareholders, however, based on the distribution that would have occurred had deferral not been elected. The $10 million deferral restriction was intended to limit the benefit of IC-DISC activity to smaller businesses.</p>
