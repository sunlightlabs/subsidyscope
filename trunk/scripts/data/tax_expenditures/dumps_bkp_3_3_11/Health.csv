#,Medical Savings Accounts/Health Savings Accounts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Medical and health savings accounts.&mdash;Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. Also, the baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures. In contrast, individual contributions to Archer Medical Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are allowed as a deduction in determining adjusted gross income whether or not the individual itemizes deductions. Employer contributions to Archer MSAs and HSAs are excluded from income and employment taxes. Archer MSAs and HSAs require that the individual have coverage by a qualifying high deductible health plan. Earnings from the accounts are excluded from taxable income. Distributions from the accounts used for medical expenses are not taxable. The rules for HSAs are generally more flexible than for Archer MSAs and the deductible contribution amounts are greater (in 2009, $3000 for taxpayers with individual coverage and $5,950 for taxpayers with family coverage). Thus, HSAs have largely replaced MSAs. </p>"
