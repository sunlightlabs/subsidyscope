                              INTRODUCTION

    Tax expenditure analysis can help both policymakers and the 
public to understand the actual size of government, the uses to 
which government resources are put, and the tax and economic 
policy consequences that follow from the implicit or explicit 
choices made in fashioning legislation. This report \1\ on tax 
expenditures for fiscal years 2009-2013 is prepared by the 
staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (``Joint Committee 
staff'') for the House Committee on Ways and Means and the 
Senate Committee on Finance. The report also is submitted to 
the House and Senate Committees on the Budget.

    As in the case of earlier reports,\2\ the estimates of tax 
expenditures in this report were prepared in consultation with 
the staff of the Office of Tax Analysis in the Department of 
the Treasury (``the Treasury''). The Treasury published its 
estimates of tax expenditures for fiscal years 2008-2014 in the 
Administration's budgetary statement of May 2009.\3\ The lists 
of tax expenditures in this Joint Committee staff report and 
the Administration's budgetary statement overlap considerably; 
the differences are discussed in Part I of this report under 
the heading ``Comparisons with Treasury.''

    The Joint Committee staff has made its estimates (as shown 
in Table 1) based on the provisions in Federal tax law as 
enacted through September 30, 2009.\4\ Expired or repealed 
provisions are not listed unless they have continuing revenue 
effects that are associated with ongoing taxpayer activity. 
Proposed extensions or modifications of expiring provisions are 
not included until they have been enacted into law. The tax 
expenditure calculations in this report are based on the August 
2009 Congressional Budget Office (``CBO'') revenue baseline and 
Joint Committee staff projections of the gross income, 
deductions, and expenditures of individuals and corporations 
for calendar years 2008-2013.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ This analysis does not include effects of the Worker, 
Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (Pub. L. No. 111-92) 
or the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 (Pub. L. No. 111-
118), which became law after the end of fiscal year 2009. The Worker, 
Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act affects the tax expenditures 
for the first-time homebuyer tax credit and the exclusion of benefits 
and allowances to armed forces personnel under the Homeowners 
Assistance Program. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act 
extends the premium subsidy for COBRA continuation coverage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Part I of this report contains a discussion of the concept 
of tax expenditures. Part II is a discussion of the measurement 
of tax expenditures. Estimates of tax expenditures for fiscal 
years 2009-2013 are presented in Table 1 in Part III. Table 2 
shows the distribution of tax returns by income class, and 
Table 3 presents distributions of selected individual tax 
expenditures by income class.

                   I. THE CONCEPT OF TAX EXPENDITURES

Overview
    Tax expenditures are defined under the Congressional Budget 
and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (the ``Budget Act'') as 
``revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Federal tax 
laws which allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction 
from gross income or which provide a special credit, a 
preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability.'' \5\ 
Thus, tax expenditures include any reductions in income tax 
liabilities that result from special tax provisions or 
regulations that provide tax benefits to particular taxpayers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Pub. 
L. No. 93-344), sec. 3(3). The Budget Act requires CBO and the Treasury 
to publish annually detailed lists of tax expenditures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Special income tax provisions are referred to as tax 
expenditures because they may be considered to be analogous to 
direct outlay programs, and the two can be considered as 
alternative means of accomplishing similar budget policy 
objectives. Tax expenditures are similar to those direct 
spending programs that are available as entitlements to those 
who meet the statutory criteria established for the programs.
    Estimates of tax expenditures are prepared for use in 
budget analysis. They are a measure of the economic benefits 
that are provided through the tax laws to various groups of 
taxpayers and sectors of the economy. The estimates also may be 
useful in determining the relative merits of achieving 
specified public goals through tax benefits or direct outlays. 
It is appropriate to evaluate tax expenditures with respect to 
cost, distributional consequences, alternative means of 
provision, and economic effects and to allow policymakers to 
evaluate the tradeoffs among these and other potentially 
competing policy goals.
    The legislative history of the Budget Act indicates that 
tax expenditures are to be defined with reference to a normal 
income tax structure (referred to here as ``normal income tax 
law''). The determination of whether a provision is a tax 
expenditure is made on the basis of a broad concept of income 
that is larger in scope than ``income'' as defined under 
general U.S. income tax principles. The Joint Committee staff 
has used its judgment in distinguishing between those income 
tax provisions (and regulations) that can be viewed as a part 
of normal income tax law and those special provisions that 
result in tax expenditures. A provision traditionally has been 
listed as a tax expenditure by the Joint Committee staff if 
there is a reasonable basis for such classification and the 
provision results in more than a de minimis revenue loss, which 
solely for this purpose means a total revenue loss of less than 
$50 million over the five fiscal years 2009-2013. The Joint 
Committee staff emphasizes, however, that in the process of 
listing tax expenditures, no judgment is made, nor any 
implication intended, about the desirability of any special tax 
provision as a matter of public policy.
    An alternative approach builds on the work of Seymour 
Fiekowsky and others, by defining a ``tax subsidy'' (a tax 
expenditure in the narrow sense) as a specific tax provision 
that is deliberately inconsistent with an identifiable general 
rule of the present tax law (not a hypothetical normal income 
tax law), and that collects less revenue than does the general 
rule.\6\ In practice, the compilation of general rules comprise 
a baseline for identifying tax subsidies that corresponds to 
the ``reference tax'' baseline that the Treasury primarily uses 
in its tax expenditure analyses and that the Joint Committee 
staff used in 2008.\7\ While this definition does not require 
the kinds of normative judgments required to construct the 
``normal'' tax base, it is not automatic in application. For 
example, there may be uncertainty as to whether there is a 
clear general rule, and if so, what that general rule may be.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ Seymour Fiekowsky, ``The Relation of Tax Expenditures to the 
Distribution of the `Fiscal Burden,' '' 2 Canadian Taxation, 1980, 211, 
215; see also Office of Management and Budget, The Budget of the United 
States Government, Fiscal Year 1983--Special Analyses G-5, 1982.

Expenditures for Fiscal Years 2008-2012 (JCS-2-08), October 31, 2008.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As a practical matter, either approach can yield a similar 
list of tax expenditures. Many of the provisions of normal 
income tax law are also general rules of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, as amended (``the Code''). Both systems generally 
allow as part of the baseline tax system, among other features, 
deferral of tax on unrealized gains; existence of a separate 
corporate income tax; a standard deduction and personal 
exemptions; variation in individual tax rates by income; 
variation in rate brackets, standard deductions, and other tax 
attributes by marital status; exclusion of gifts between 
individuals from gross income; deductibility of the expenses of 
earning income; economic depreciation; and credit for foreign 
income taxes paid to prevent double taxation of income earned 
abroad.\8\ As a result, a provision identified as a tax 
expenditure under the general rules of the Code generally is 
identified as a tax expenditure under the normal income tax law 
baseline; however, the reverse is not always true. The primary 
areas of departure relate to accelerated depreciation (of which 
expensing is an extreme form), deferral of income of controlled 
foreign corporations (``CFCs''), and exclusion of certain cash 
transfers from income.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ The rationales for inclusion of items in this list, and, 
indeed, for designation as tax expenditures, vary. For example, while 
taxation of accrued but unrealized gains is consistent with the broad 
concept of normal income, nontaxation of accrued gains is not treated 
as a tax expenditure because of the infeasibility of its 
implementation. Other considerations include how much a provision 
contributes to compliance and/or systemic equity.
    \9\ In its 2008 tax expenditure report, the Joint Committee staff 
identifies five major provisions that would be classified as tax 
expenditures under the normal income tax law baseline that are not 
classified as tax subsidies under the general rules of the Code. Three 
of these items relate to accelerated depreciation; two relate to 
deferral of income of CFCs. See ibid., Table 4, p. 69. In its 2009 tax 
expenditure report, Treasury identifies nine such provisions: five 
relate to accelerated depreciation; two relate to exclusion of certain 
cash transfers from income; one relates to deferral of income of CFCs; 
and one relates to graduated corporation income tax rates. See Office 
of Management and Budget, ``Tax Expenditures,'' Analytical 
Perspectives, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2010, 
May 7, 2009, pp. 299-302.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Given the similarity of the two approaches, the generally 
more expansive list of provisions identified relative to the 
normal income tax baseline, and continuity with the historical 
approach of the Joint Committee staff since 1972, this pamphlet 
resumes implementation of the tax expenditure concept under a 
normal income tax baseline, adjusted to include additional tax 
expenditures (negative and otherwise) presented on the basis of 
traditional budget functions.
    The Budget Act uses the term tax expenditure to refer to 
the special tax provisions that are contained in the Federal 
income taxes on individuals and corporations.\10\ Other Federal 
taxes such as excise taxes, employment taxes, and estate and 
gift taxes may also have exceptions, exclusions, and credits, 
but those special tax provisions are not included in this 
report because they are not part of the income tax. Thus, for 
example, the income tax exclusion for employer-paid health 
insurance is included, but the Federal Insurance Contributions 
Act (``FICA'') tax exclusion for employer-paid health insurance 
is not treated as a tax expenditure in this report.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ The Federal income tax on individuals also applies to estates 
and trusts, which are subject to a separate income tax rate schedule 
(sec. 1(e) of the Code). Estates and trusts may benefit from some of 
the same tax expenditure provisions that apply to individuals. In Table 
1 of this report, the tax expenditures that apply to estates and trusts 
have been included in the estimates of tax expenditures for individual 
taxpayers.
    \11\ Other analysts have explored applying the concept of tax 
expenditures to payroll and excise taxes. See Jonathan Barry Forman, 
``Would a Social Security Tax Expenditure Budget Make Sense?'' Public 
Budgeting and Financial Management, 5, 1993, pp. 311-335, and Bruce F. 
Davie, ``Tax Expenditures in the Federal Excise Tax System,'' National 
Tax Journal, 47, March 1994, pp. 39-62. Prior to 2003, the President's 
budget contained a section that reviewed and tabulated estate and gift 
tax provisions that the Treasury considered tax expenditures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Some provisions in the Code provide for special tax 
treatment that is less favorable than normal income tax law. 
Examples of such provisions include (1) the denial of 
deductions for certain lobbying expenses, (2) the denial of 
deductions for certain executive compensation, and (3) the two-
percent floor on itemized deductions for unreimbursed employee 
expenses. Tax provisions that provide treatment less favorable 
than normal income tax law and are not related directly to 
progressivity are called negative tax expenditures.\12\ Special 
provisions of the law the principal purpose for which is to 
enforce general tax rules, or to prevent the violation of other 
laws, are not treated as negative tax expenditures even though 
they may increase the tax burden for certain taxpayers. 
Examples of these compliance and enforcement provisions include 
(1) the section 382 limitation on net operating loss 
carryforwards and certain built-in losses following ownership 
changes, (2) the section 1091 wash sale rules, (3) the section 
1287 denial of capital gain treatment for gains on certain 
obligations not in registered form, and (4) the section 162(f) 
disallowance of a deduction for fines and penalties.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ Although the Budget Act does not require the identification of 
negative tax expenditures, the Joint Committee staff has presented a 
number of negative tax expenditures for completeness.
    \13\ See Joint Committee on Taxation, Estimates of Federal Tax 
Expenditures for Fiscal Years 2008-2012 (JCS-2-08), October 31, 2008, 
9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Individual Income Tax
    Under the Joint Committee staff methodology, the normal 
structure of the individual income tax includes the following 
major components: one personal exemption for each taxpayer and 
one for each dependent, the standard deduction, the existing 
tax rate schedule, and deductions for investment and employee 
business expenses. Most other tax benefits to individual 
taxpayers are classified as exceptions to normal income tax 
law.
    The Joint Committee staff views the personal exemptions and 
the standard deduction as defining the zero-rate bracket that 
is a part of normal tax law. An itemized deduction that is not 
necessary for the generation of income is classified as a tax 
expenditure, but only to the extent that it, when added to a 
taxpayer's other itemized deductions, exceeds the standard 
deduction.
    All employee compensation is subject to tax unless the Code 
contains a specific exclusion for the income. Specific 
exclusions for employer-provided benefits include: coverage 
under accident and health plans,\14\ accident and disability 
insurance, group term life insurance, educational assistance, 
tuition reduction benefits, transportation benefits (parking, 
van pools, and transit passes), dependent care assistance, 
adoption assistance, meals and lodging furnished for the 
convenience of the employer, employee awards, and other 
miscellaneous fringe benefits (e.g., employee discounts, 
services provided to employees at no additional cost to 
employers, and de minimis fringe benefits). Each of these 
exclusions is classified as a tax expenditure in this report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ Present law contains an exclusion for employer-provided 
coverage under accident and health plans (sec. 106) and an exclusion 
for benefits received by employees under employer-provided accident and 
health plans (sec. 105(b)). These two exclusions are viewed as a single 
tax expenditure. Under normal income tax law, the value of employer-
provided accident and health coverage would be includable in the income 
of employees, but employees would not be subject to tax on the accident 
and health insurance benefits (reimbursements) that they might receive.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Under normal income tax law, employer contributions to 
pension plans and income earned on pension assets generally 
would be taxable to employees as the contributions are made and 
as the income is earned, and employees would not receive any 
deduction or exclusion for their pension contributions. Under 
present law, employer contributions to qualified pension plans 
and employee contributions made at the election of the employee 
through salary reduction are not taxed until distributed to the 
employee, and income earned on pension assets is not taxed 
until distributed. The tax expenditure for ``net exclusion of 
pension contributions and earnings'' is computed as the income 
taxes forgone on current tax-excluded pension contributions and 
earnings less the income taxes paid on current pension 
distributions (including the 10-percent additional tax paid on 
early withdrawals from pension plans).
    Under present law, social security and tier 1 railroad 
retirement benefits are partially excluded or fully excluded 
from gross income.\15\ Under normal income tax law, retirees 
would be entitled to exclude only the portion of the retirement 
benefits that represents a return of the payroll taxes that 
they paid during their working years. Thus, the exclusion of 
social security and railroad retirement benefits in excess of 
payroll tax payments is classified as a tax expenditure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \15\ For taxpayers with modified adjusted gross incomes above 
certain levels, up to 85 percent of social security and tier 1 railroad 
retirement benefits are includable in income.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    All Medicare benefits are excluded from taxation. The value 
of Medicare Part A insurance generally is greater than the 
Health Insurance (``HI'') tax contributions that enrollees made 
during their working years, the value of Medicare Part B 
insurance generally is greater than the Part B premium that 
enrollees must pay, and the value of Medicare Part D 
(prescription drug) insurance generally is greater than the 
Part D premium that enrollees must pay. The exclusion of the 
value of Medicare Part A insurance in excess of HI tax 
contributions is classified as a tax expenditure, as are the 
exclusion of the value of Medicare Part B insurance in excess 
of Part B premiums and the exclusion of the value of Part D 
insurance in excess of Part D premiums.
    Public assistance benefits are excluded from gross income 
by statute or by Treasury regulations. Table 1 contains tax 
expenditure calculations for workers' compensation benefits, 
special benefits for disabled coal miners, and cash public 
assistance benefits (which include Supplemental Security Income 
benefits and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits).
    The individual income tax does not include in gross income 
the imputed income that individuals receive from the services 
provided by owner-occupied homes and durable goods.\16\ 
However, the Joint Committee staff does not classify this 
exclusion as a tax expenditure.\17\ The measurement of imputed 
income for tax purposes presents administrative problems and 
its exclusion from taxable income may be regarded as an 
administrative necessity.\18\ Under normal income tax law, 
individuals would be allowed to deduct only the interest on 
indebtedness incurred in connection with a trade or business or 
an investment. Thus, the deduction for mortgage interest on a 
principal or second residence is classified as a tax 
expenditure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ The National Income and Product Accounts include estimates of 
this imputed income. The accounts appear in Survey of Current Business, 
published monthly by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of 
Economic Analysis. However, a taxpayer-by-taxpayer accounting of 
imputed income would be necessary for a tax expenditure estimate.
    \17\ The Treasury Department provides a tax expenditure calculation 
for the exclusion of net rental income of homeowners that combines the 
positive tax expenditure for the failure to impute rental income with 
the negative tax expenditure for the failure to allow a deduction for 
depreciation and other costs.
    \18\ If the imputed income from owner-occupied homes were included 
in adjusted gross income, it would be proper to include all mortgage 
interest deductions and related property tax deductions as part of the 
normal income tax structure, since interest and property tax deductions 
would be allowable as a cost of producing imputed income. It also would 
be appropriate to allow deductions for depreciation and maintenance 
expenses for owner-occupied homes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Joint Committee staff assumes that, for administrative 
feasibility, normal income tax law would tax capital gains in 
full in the year the gains are realized through sale, exchange, 
gift, or transfer at death. Thus, the deferral of tax until 
realization is not classified as a tax expenditure. However, 
reduced rates of tax, further deferrals of tax (beyond the year 
of sale, exchange, gift, or transfer at death), and exclusions 
of certain capital gains are classified as tax expenditures. 
Because of the same concern for administrative feasibility, it 
also is assumed that normal income tax law would not provide 
for any indexing of the basis of capital assets for changes in 
the general price level. Thus, under normal income tax law (as 
under present law), the income tax would be levied on nominal 
gains as opposed to real gains in asset values.
    There are many types of State and local government bonds 
and private purpose bonds that qualify for tax-exempt status 
for Federal income tax purposes. Table 1 contains a separate 
tax expenditure listing for each type of bond.
    Under the Joint Committee staff view of normal tax law, 
compensatory stock options would be subject to regular income 
tax at the time the options are exercised and employers would 
receive a corresponding tax deduction.\19\ The employee's 
income would be equal to the difference between the purchase 
price of the stock and the market price on the day the option 
is exercised. Present law provides for special tax treatment 
for incentive stock options and options acquired under employee 
stock purchase plans. When certain requirements are satisfied, 
then: (1) the income that is received at the time the option is 
exercised is excluded for purposes of the regular income tax 
but, in the case of an incentive stock option, included for 
purposes of the alternative minimum tax (``AMT''); (2) the gain 
from any subsequent sale of the stock is taxed as a capital 
gain; and (3) the employer does not receive a tax deduction 
with respect to the option. The special tax treatment provided 
to the employee is viewed as a tax expenditure by the Joint 
Committee staff, and an estimate of this tax expenditure is 
contained in Table 1. However, it should be noted that the 
revenue loss from the special tax treatment provided to the 
employee is accompanied by a significant revenue gain from the 
denial of the deduction to the employer. The negative tax 
expenditure created by the denial of the deduction for 
employers is incorporated in the calculation of the tax 
expenditure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ If the option has a readily ascertainable fair market value, 
normal law would tax the option at the time it is granted and the 
employer would be entitled to a deduction at that time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The individual AMT and the passive activity loss rules are 
not viewed by the Joint Committee staff as a part of normal 
income tax law. Instead, they are viewed as provisions that 
reduce the magnitude of the tax expenditures to which they 
apply. For example, the AMT reduces the value of the deduction 
for State and local income taxes (for those taxpayers subject 
to the AMT) by not allowing the deductions to be claimed in the 
calculation of AMT liability. Similarly, the passive loss rules 
defer otherwise allowable deductions and credits from passive 
activities until a time when the taxpayer has passive income or 
disposes of the assets associated with the passive activity. 
Exceptions to the individual AMT and the passive loss rules are 
not classified as tax expenditures by the Joint Committee staff 
because the effects of the exceptions already are incorporated 
in the estimates of related tax expenditures. In one case the 
restrictive effects of the AMT are presented separately because 
there are no underlying positive tax expenditures reflecting 
these effects: the negative tax expenditures for the AMT's 
disallowance of personal exemptions and the standard deduction.

Business Income Taxation

    Regardless of the legal form of organization (sole 
proprietorship, partnership, or S or C corporation), the same 
general principles are used in the computation of taxable 
business income. Thus, most business tax expenditures apply 
equally to unincorporated and incorporated businesses.
    One of the most difficult issues in defining tax 
expenditures for business income relates to the tax treatment 
of capital costs. Under present law, capital costs may be 
recovered under a variety of alternative methods, depending 
upon the nature of the costs and the status of the taxpayer. 
For example, investments in equipment and structures may 
qualify for tax credits, expensing, accelerated depreciation, 
or straight-line depreciation. The Joint Committee staff 
generally classifies as tax expenditures, cost-recovery 
allowances that are more favorable than those provided under 
the alternative depreciation system (sec. 168(g)), which 
provides for straight-line recovery over tax lives that are 
longer than those permitted under the accelerated system. In 
addition, a tax expenditure has been measured for depreciation 
in those specific cases where the tax treatment of a certain 
type of asset deviates from the overall treatment of other 
similar types of assets. For example, the tax treatment of 
leasehold improvements of commercial buildings is depreciated 
using a recovery period of 15 years, while the general 
treatment of improvements to commercial buildings (e.g., owned 
commercial buildings) is a 39-year recovery period. In this 
case, the difference between depreciation (in this case 
straight line) using 15 years and 39 years for the recovery 
period represents a tax expenditure. As indicated above, the 
Joint Committee staff assumes that normal income tax law would 
not provide for any indexing of the basis of capital assets 
(nor, for that matter, any indexing with respect to expenses 
associated with these assets). Thus, normal income tax law 
would not take into account the effects of inflation on tax 
depreciation.
    The Joint Committee staff uses several accounting standards 
in evaluating the provisions in the Code that govern the 
recognition of business receipts and expenses. Under the Joint 
Committee staff view, normal income tax law is assumed to 
require the accrual method of accounting (except where its 
application is deemed infeasible), the standard of ``economic 
performance'' (used in the Code to test whether liabilities are 
deductible), and the general concept of matching income and 
expenses. In general, tax provisions that do not satisfy all 
three standards are viewed as tax expenditures. For example, 
the deduction for contributions to taxpayer-controlled mining 
reclamation reserve accounts is viewed as a tax expenditure 
because the contributions do not satisfy the economic 
performance standard. (Adherence to the standard would require 
that the taxpayer make an irrevocable contribution toward 
future reclamation, involving a trust fund or similar 
mechanism, as occurs in a number of areas in the Code.) As 
another example, the deductions for contributions to nuclear 
decommissioning trust accounts and certain environmental 
settlement trust accounts are not viewed as tax expenditures 
because the contributions are irrevocable (i.e., they satisfy 
the economic performance standard). However, present law 
provides for a reduced rate of tax on the incomes of these two 
types of trust accounts, and these tax rate reductions are 
viewed as tax expenditures.
    The Joint Committee staff assumes that normal income tax 
law would provide for the carryback and carryforward of net 
operating losses. The staff also assumes that the general 
limits on the number of years that such losses may be carried 
back or forward were chosen for reasons of administrative 
convenience and compliance concerns and may be assumed to 
represent normal income tax law. Exceptions to the general 
limits on carrybacks and carryforwards are viewed as tax 
expenditures.

Corporate Income Tax

    The income of corporations (other than S corporations) 
generally is subject to the corporate income tax. The corporate 
income tax includes a graduated tax rate schedule. The lower 
tax rates in the schedule are classified by the Joint Committee 
staff as a tax expenditure (as opposed to normal income tax 
law) because they are intended to provide tax benefits to small 
business and, unlike the graduated individual income tax rates, 
are unrelated directly to concerns about ability of individuals 
to pay taxes.
    Exceptions to the corporate alternative minimum tax are not 
viewed as tax expenditures because the effects of the AMT 
exceptions are already incorporated in the estimates of related 
tax expenditures.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \20\ See discussion of the individual AMT above.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Certain income of pass-through entities is exempt from the 
corporate income tax. The income of sole proprietorships, S 
corporations, most partnerships, and other entities (such as 
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, 
real estate mortgage investment conduits, and cooperatives) is 
taxed only at the individual level. The special tax rules for 
these pass-through entities are not classified as tax 
expenditures because the tax benefits are available to any 
entity that chooses to organize itself and operate in the 
required manner.
    Nonprofit corporations that satisfy the requirements of 
section 501 also generally are exempt from corporate income 
tax. The tax exemption for organizations that have a direct 
business analogue or compete with for-profit organizations 
organized for similar purposes is a tax expenditure.\21\ The 
tax exemption for certain nonprofit cooperative business 
organizations, such as trade associations, is not treated as a 
tax expenditure just as the entity-level exemption given to 
for-profit pass-through business entities is not treated as a 
tax expenditure. With respect to other nonprofit organizations, 
such as charities, tax-exempt status is not classified as a tax 
expenditure because the nonbusiness activities of such 
organizations generally must predominate and their unrelated 
business activities are subject to tax. However, there are 
numerous exceptions that allow for otherwise unrelated business 
income to escape taxation,\22\ and these exceptions are treated 
as tax expenditures. In general, the imputed income derived 
from nonbusiness activities conducted by individuals or 
collectively by certain nonprofit organizations is outside the 
normal income tax base. However, the ability of donors to such 
nonprofit organizations to claim a charitable contribution 
deduction is a tax expenditure, as is the exclusion of income 
granted to holders of tax-exempt financing issued by charities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \21\ These organizations include small insurance companies, mutual 
or cooperative electric companies, State credit unions, and Federal 
credit unions.
    \22\ These exceptions include certain passive income that arguably 
may relate to business activities, such as royalties or rents received 
from licensing trade names or other assets typically used in a trade or 
business, as well as other passive income such as certain dividends and 
interest. Other exceptions include income derived from certain research 
activities and income from certain trade show and fair activities.

Recent Legislation

    The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, enacted 
on February 17, 2009 (Pub. L. No. 111-5), created 15 new tax

instrument in 2009 or 2010 was deferred until the fifth taxable 
year, for reacquisitions occurring in 2009 (or fourth taxable 
year for reacquisitions occurring in 2010), following the 
taxable year in which the reacquisition occurs. The rule that 
partially denies the deduction for original issue discount in 
the case of an applicable high-yield discount obligation was 
suspended for certain obligations issued in a debt-for-debt

as a tax preference for purposes of the alternative minimum 
tax, and the inclusion of tax-exempt interest in the corporate 
adjustment based on current earnings, were suspended.
    --The issuance of qualified school construction bonds (with

1, 2011.
    --A $250 credit ($500 for a joint return where both spouses 
are eligible) against income taxes owed for tax year 2009 was

continuation coverage was provided for unemployed workers and 
their families, effective for individuals who are involuntarily 
terminated on or after September 1, 2008, and before January 1, 
2010, and effective only for a maximum of nine months of

2009.
    The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 also 
extended or modified several existing tax expenditures, as 
follows:
    --The earned-income tax credit was increased for certain 
taxpayers with three or more qualifying children and for 
certain joint taxpayers, effective for taxable years beginning 
in 2009 and 2010.
    --The earnings threshold for the refundable portion of the 
child tax credit was reduced to $3,000, effective for taxable 
years beginning in 2009 and 2010.
    --The Hope Scholarship Credit was increased to a maximum of 
$2,500, was made available for each of the first four years of 
a student's post-secondary education, and was made 40-percent 
refundable. For purposes of the credit, the definition of 
qualified tuition was expanded to include course materials, and 
the income phase-out range was increased. The changes are 
effective for taxable years beginning in 2009 and 2010.
    --The definition of qualified higher education expense for 
qualified tuition programs (sec. 529) was expanded to include 
computer technology and equipment, effective for expenses paid 
or incurred in 2009 or 2010.
    --The first-time homebuyer credit, which was scheduled to 
expire for homes purchased after June 30, 2009, was extended to 
expire for homes purchased after November 30, 2009. The maximum 
credit was increased from $7,500 to $8,000 and the repayment 
requirement was waived for homes not sold within 36 months of 
purchase, effective for homes purchased after December 31, 
2008, and before December 1, 2009.
    --For purposes of the electricity production credit, the 
time period during which qualified facilities (wind, closed-
loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, municipal 
solid waste, qualified hydropower, and marine renewables) may 
be placed in service was extended by three years (two years for 
marine renewables), through December 31, 2013 (December 31, 
2012, for wind facilities).
    --The credit cap applicable to qualified small wind energy 
property and the rule that reduces the credit when the property 
has received subsidized energy financing were both eliminated, 
effective for periods after December 31, 2008.
    --The limitation on issuance of new clean renewable energy 
bonds (``CREBs'') was increased by $1.6 billion, effective on 
February 17, 2009.
    --The limitation on issuance of qualified energy

billion, effective on February 17, 2009.
    --The credit for nonbusiness energy property, which was 
scheduled to expire for expenditures made after December 31, 
2009, was extended to expire for expenditures made after 
December 31, 2010. The credit rate was increased from 10 
percent to 30 percent, the credit cap was increased from $500 
to $1,500, and the credit reduction related to subsidized 
energy financing was eliminated, effective for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 2008.
    --The credit cap for residential wind, geothermal, and 
solar thermal property, and the reduction in credits for 
property using subsidized energy financing were eliminated, 
effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008.
    --The credit rate for nonhydrogen alternative fuel vehicle 
refueling property was increased from 30 percent to 50 percent, 
the maximum credit available for business property was 
increased to $200,000 for hydrogen refueling property and

taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008, for property 
placed in service in 2009 or 2010.
    --The plug-in electric drive motor vehicle credit was 
modified in several ways. As discussed above, the Act created a 
new maximum credit of $2,500 for electric drive low-speed 
vehicles, motorcycles, and three-wheeled vehicles and a new 
credit for converting a vehicle into a plug-in electric drive 
motor vehicle, for vehicles sold and for conversions made 
before December 31, 2011. The Act also limited the maximum 
plug-in electric drive motor vehicle credit to $7,500, 
eliminated the credit for low speed plug-in vehicles and for 
plug-in vehicles weighing 14,000 pounds or more, replaced the 
total vehicle limitation with a per manufacturer limitation, 
for vehicles acquired after December 31, 2009. The credit is a 
personal credit allowed against the AMT for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 2008.
    --The treatment of the alternative motor vehicle credit as 
a personal credit allowed against the AMT was provided, 
effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008.
    --The exclusion of employer-provided transit and vanpool 
benefits was increased from $120 per month to $230 (and indexed 
for inflation in 2010), effective for months beginning on or 
after February 17, 2009, and scheduled to expire for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 2010.
    --The additional first-year depreciation deduction for 
certain business property, which was scheduled to expire for

increased from two years to five years for businesses with 
gross receipts of $15 million or less, effective for net 
operating losses generated in either a taxable year beginning 
in 2008 or a taxable year ending in 2008.
    --The percentage exclusion for qualified small business 
stock sold by an individual was increased from 50 percent to 75 
percent, effective for stock issued after February 17, 2009, 
and before January 1, 2011.
    --The recognition period for built-in gains of S 
corporations was reduced from 10 years to seven years, 
effective for any taxable year beginning in 2009 or 2010.

interest expense attributable to tax-exempt interest was 
eliminated for certain small issuers in some instances, 
effective for tax-exempt obligations issued during 2009 or 
2010.
    --The high-speed intercity rail vehicle speed requirement 
for exempt high-speed rail facility bonds was modified, 
effective for obligations issued after February 17, 2009.
    --The national limitation on zone academy bonds, which was 
scheduled to decrease from $400 million in 2008 to zero 
thereafter, was increased to $1.4 billion in 2009 and 2010, 
effective for obligations issued after December 31, 2008.
    --The amount of the health coverage tax credit was 
increased to 80 percent of the taxpayer's premiums for 
qualified health insurance of the taxpayer and qualifying 
family members, effective for coverage months beginning on or 
after May 1, 2009, and before January 1, 2011.
    --The general rule that basis of a qualified building must 
be reduced by the amount of any federal grant with respect to 
such building was modified such that low-income housing grants 
received in lieu of credits do not reduce the tax basis of a 
qualified low-income building, effective on February 17, 2009.

Expiring Tax Expenditure Provisions

    A number of tax expenditure provisions expired, or are 
scheduled to expire, in 2009. These determinations reflect 
present law as of September 30, 2009:
    --The tax credit for Indian coal produced at Indian coal 
production facilities expired for facilities placed in service 
after December 31, 2008. The tax expenditure estimate in Table 
1 reflects the tax credit for facilities placed in service 
before January 1, 2009.
    --The treatment of mineral royalties as qualified REIT 
income for timber REITs is scheduled to expire on the last day 
of the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after May 22, 
2008, and before May 23, 2009. This tax expenditure is not 
listed in Table 1 because the estimated revenue loss is below 
the de minimis amount.
    --The treatment of sales by REITs of certain timber 
property as sale of property held for investment or used in a 
trade or business is scheduled to expire for sales after the 
last day of the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after 
May 22, 2008, and before May 23, 2009. This tax expenditure is 
not listed in Table 1 because the estimated revenue loss is 
below the de minimis amount.
    --The temporary reduction in corporate rate for qualified 
timber gain is scheduled to expire for taxable years beginning 
after May 22, 2009.
    --The tax credit for first-time homebuyers is scheduled to 
expire for residences purchased after November 30, 2009.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \23\ This credit was modified and extended (generally through April 
30, 2010) by the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 
2009, Pub. L. No. 111-92, secs. 11, 12.

income housing projects for low-income housing credit 
allocation is scheduled to expire after December 31, 2009.
    --The tax credit for electricity produced at open-loop 
biomass facilities placed in service before October 22, 2004, 
is scheduled to expire after December 31, 2009.
    --The tax credit for refined coal produced at refined coal 
production facilities is scheduled to expire for facilities 
placed in service after December 31, 2009.
    --The Indian employment tax credit is scheduled to expire 
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009.

    --The period for incurring qualified expenditures for 
purposes of credit for production of low sulfur diesel fuel for 
small refiners in compliance with EPA sulfur regulations is 
scheduled to end on December 31, 2009. This tax expenditure is 
not listed in Table 1 because the estimated revenue loss is 
below the de minimis amount.
    --The tax credit for producing coke or coke gas is 
scheduled to expire for facilities placed in service after 
December 31, 2009. In Table 1, this is reflected in the tax

nonconventional source.''
    --The tax credit for construction of new energy efficient 
homes is scheduled to expire for homes purchased after December 
31, 2009.
    --The tax credit for training costs of mine rescue team

Table 1 because the estimated revenue loss is below the de 
minimis amount.
    --The tax credit for wages of employees who are active duty 
members of the uniformed services is scheduled to expire for 
payments made after December 31, 2009. This tax expenditure is

Comparisons with Treasury

    The Joint Committee staff and Treasury lists of tax 
expenditures differ in at least six respects. First, the Joint 
Committee staff and the Treasury use differing methodologies 
for the estimation of tax expenditures. Thus, the estimates in 
Table 1 are not necessarily comparable with the estimates 
prepared by the Treasury. Under the Joint Committee staff 
methodology, each tax expenditure is measured by the difference 
between tax liability under present law and the tax liability 
that would result if the tax expenditure provision were 
repealed and taxpayers were allowed to take advantage of any of 
the remaining tax expenditure provisions that apply to the 
income or the expenses associated with the repealed tax 
expenditure.
    For example, the tax expenditure provision for the 
exclusion of employer-paid health insurance is measured by the 
difference between tax liability under present law and the tax 
liability that would result if the exclusion were repealed and 
taxpayers were allowed to claim the next best tax treatment for 
the previously excluded employer-paid health insurance. This 
next best tax treatment could be the inclusion of the employer-
paid health insurance as an itemized medical deduction on 
Schedule A.\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \25\ If the exclusion were repealed, the value of the employer-paid 
health insurance would be included in income and taxpayers would be 
treated as having purchased the insurance themselves. Thus, the 
insurance expense would be deductible as an itemized medical expense on 
Schedule A, subject to the itemized medical deduction floor (7.5 
percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Under the Treasury methodology, each tax expenditure is 
measured by the difference between tax liability under present 
law and the tax liability that would result if the tax 
expenditure provision were repealed and taxpayers were 
prohibited from taking advantage of any of the remaining tax 
expenditure provisions that apply to the income or the expenses 
associated with the repealed tax expenditure. For example, the 
tax expenditure provision for the exclusion for employer-paid 
health insurance is measured by the difference between tax 
liability under present law and the tax liability that would 
result if the exclusion were repealed and taxpayers were 
required to include all of the employer-paid health insurance 
in income, with no offsetting deductions (i.e., no 
deductibility on Schedule A).
    Second, the Treasury uses a different classification of 
those provisions that can be considered a part of normal income 
tax law under both the individual and business income taxes. In 
general, the Joint Committee staff methodology involves a 
broader definition of the normal income tax base. Thus, the 
Joint Committee list of tax expenditures includes some 
provisions that are not contained in the Treasury list. The 
cash method of accounting by certain businesses provides an 
example. The Treasury considers the cash accounting option for 
certain businesses to be a part of normal income tax law, but 
the Joint Committee staff methodology treats it as a departure 
from normal income tax law that constitutes a tax expenditure.
    Third, the Joint Committee staff and the Treasury estimates 
of tax expenditures may also differ as a result of differing 
data sources and differences in baseline projections of incomes 
and expenses. The Treasury's tax expenditure calculations are 
based on the Administration's economic forecast. The Joint 
Committee staff calculations are based on the economic forecast 
prepared by the CBO.
    Fourth, the Joint Committee staff and the Treasury 
estimates of tax expenditures span slightly different sets of 
years. The Treasury's estimates cover a seven-year period: the 
last fiscal year, the current fiscal year when the President's 
budget is submitted, and the next five fiscal years, i.e., 
fiscal years 2008-2014. The Joint Committee staff estimates 
cover a recent fiscal year and the succeeding four fiscal 
years, i.e., fiscal years 2009-2013.
    Fifth, the Joint Committee staff list excludes those 
provisions that are estimated to result in revenue losses below 
the de minimis amount, i.e., less than $50 million over the 
five fiscal years 2009 through 2013. The Treasury rounds all 
yearly estimates to the nearest $10 million and excludes those 
provisions with estimates that round to zero in each year, 
i.e., provisions that result in less than $5 million in revenue 
loss in each of the years 2008 through 2014.
    Finally, the Joint Committee staff list formally integrates 
negative tax expenditures into its standard presentation.
    In some cases, two or more of the tax expenditure items in 
the Treasury list have been combined into a single item in the 
Joint Committee staff list, and vice versa. The Table 1 
descriptions of some tax expenditures also may vary from the 
descriptions used by the Treasury.

                  II. MEASUREMENT OF TAX EXPENDITURES

Tax expenditure calculations generally
    A tax expenditure is measured by the difference between tax 
liability under present law and the tax liability that would 
result from a recomputation of tax without benefit of the tax 
expenditure provision.\26\ Taxpayer behavior is assumed to 
remain unchanged for tax expenditure estimate purposes.\27\ 
This assumption is made to simplify the calculation and conform 
to the presentation of government outlays. This approach to tax 
expenditure measurement is in contrast to the approach taken in 
revenue estimating; all of our revenue estimates do reflect 
anticipated taxpayer behavior.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \26\ An alternative way to measure tax expenditures is to express 
their values in terms of ``outlay equivalents.'' An outlay equivalent 
is the dollar size of a direct spending program that would provide 
taxpayers with net benefits that would equal what they now receive from 
a tax expenditure. For positive tax expenditures, the major difference 
between outlay equivalents and the tax expenditure calculations 
presented here is accounting for whether a tax expenditure converted 
into an outlay payment would itself be taxable, so that a gross-up 
might be needed to deliver the equivalent after-tax benefits.
    \27\ An exception to this absence of behavior in tax expenditure 
calculations is that a taxpayer is assumed to make simple additions or 
deletions in filing tax forms, what the Joint Committee staff refers to 
as ``tax form behavior.'' For example, as noted above, if the exclusion 
for employer-paid health insurance were repealed, taxpayers would be 
allowed to claim the next best tax treatment for the previously 
excluded insurance. This next best tax treatment could be the inclusion 
of the employer-paid health insurance as an itemized medical deduction 
on Schedule A. Similarly, a taxpayer that is eligible for one of two 
alternative credits is assumed to file for the second credit if the 
first credit is eliminated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The tax expenditure calculations in this report are based 
on the August 2009 CBO revenue baseline and Joint Committee 
staff projections of the gross income, deductions, and 
expenditures of individuals and corporations for calendar years 
2008-2013. These projections are used to compute tax 
liabilities for the present-law revenue baseline and tax 
liabilities for the alternative baseline that assumes that the 
tax expenditure provision does not exist.
    Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') statistics from recent 
tax returns are used to develop projections of the tax credits, 
deductions, and exclusions that will be claimed (or that will 
be denied in the case of negative tax expenditures) under the 
present-law baseline. These IRS statistics show the actual 
usage of the various tax expenditure provisions. In the case of 
some tax expenditures, such as the earned income credit, there 
is evidence that some taxpayers are not claiming all of the 
benefits to which they are entitled, while others are filing 
claims that exceed their entitlements. The tax expenditure 
calculations in this report are based on projections of actual 
claims under the various tax provisions, not the potential tax 
benefits to which taxpayers are entitled.
    Some tax expenditure calculations are based partly on 
statistics for income, deductions, and expenses for prior 
years. Accelerated depreciation is an example. Estimates for 
this tax expenditure are based on the difference between tax 
depreciation deductions under present law and the deductions 
that would have been claimed in the current year if investments 
in the current year and all prior years had been depreciated 
using the alternative (normal income tax law) depreciation 
system.
    Each tax expenditure is calculated separately, under the 
assumption that all other tax expenditures remain in the Code. 
If two or more tax expenditures were estimated simultaneously, 
the total change in tax liability could be smaller or larger 
than the sum of the amounts shown for each item separately, as 
a result of interactions among the tax expenditure 
provisions.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \28\ See Leonard E. Burman, Christopher Geissler, and Eric J. 
Toder, ``How Big Are Total Individual Income Tax Expenditures, and Who 
Benefits from Them?'' American Economic Review, 98, May 2008, pp. 79-
83.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Year-to-year differences in the calculations for each tax 
expenditure reflect changes in tax law, including phaseouts of 
tax expenditure provisions and changes that alter the 
definition of the normal income tax structure, such as the tax 
rate schedule, the personal exemption amount, and the standard 
deduction. Some of the calculations for this tax expenditure 
report may differ from estimates made in previous years because 
of changes in law and economic conditions, the availability of 
better data, and improved measurement techniques.
    If a tax expenditure provision were eliminated, Congress 
might choose to continue financial assistance through other 
means rather than terminate all Federal assistance for the 
activity. If a replacement spending program were enacted, the 
higher revenues received as a result of the elimination of a 
tax expenditure might not represent a net budget gain. A 
replacement program could involve direct expenditures, direct 
loans or loan guarantees, regulatory activity, a mandate, a 
different form of tax expenditure, or a general reduction in 
tax rates. Joint Committee staff estimates of tax expenditures 
do not anticipate such policy responses.
Tax expenditures versus revenue estimates
    A tax expenditure calculation is not the same as a revenue 
estimate for the repeal of the tax expenditure provision for 
three reasons. First, unlike revenue estimates, tax expenditure 
calculations do not incorporate the effects of the behavioral 
changes that are anticipated to occur in response to the repeal 
of a tax expenditure provision. Second, tax expenditure 
calculations are concerned with changes in the reported tax 
liabilities of taxpayers.\29\ Because tax expenditure analysis 
focuses on tax liabilities as opposed to Federal government tax 
receipts, there is no concern for the short-term timing of tax 
payments. Revenue estimates are concerned with changes in 
Federal tax receipts that are affected by the timing of all tax 
payments. Third, some of the tax provisions that provide an 
exclusion from income also apply to the FICA tax base, and the 
repeal of the income tax provision would automatically increase 
FICA tax revenues as well as income tax revenues. This FICA 
effect would be reflected in revenue estimates, but is not 
considered in tax expenditure calculations. There may also be 
interactions between income tax provisions and other Federal 
taxes such as excise taxes and the estate and gift tax.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \29\ Reported tax liabilities may reflect compliance issues, and 
thus calculations of tax expenditures reflect existing compliance 
issues.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If a tax expenditure provision were repealed, it is likely 
that the repeal would be made effective for taxable years 
beginning after a certain date. Because most individual 
taxpayers have taxable years that coincide with the calendar 
year, the repeal of a provision affecting the individual income 
tax most likely would be effective for taxable years beginning 
after December 31 of a certain year. However, the Federal 
government's fiscal year begins October 1. Thus, the revenue 
estimate for repeal of a provision would show a smaller revenue 
gain in the first fiscal year than in subsequent fiscal years. 
This is due to the fact that the repeal would be effective 
after the start of the Federal government's fiscal year. The 
revenue estimate might also reflect some delay in the timing of 
the revenue gains as a result of the taxpayer tendency to 
postpone or forgo changes in tax withholding and estimated tax 
payments, and very often repeal or modification of a tax 
provision includes transition relief that would not be captured 
in a tax expenditure calculation.

    Tax expenditures are grouped in Table 1 in the same 
functional categories as outlays in the Federal budget. 
Estimates are shown separately for individuals and 
corporations. Those tax expenditures that do not fit clearly 
into any single budget category have been placed in the most 
appropriate category.
    Several of the tax expenditure items involve small amounts 
of revenue, and those estimates are indicated in Table 1 by 
foot-
notes 2 and 5. For each of these items, the footnote means that 
the tax expenditure is less than $50 million in the fiscal 
year.
    Table 2 presents projections of tax return information for 
each of nine income classes on the number of all returns 
(including filing and nonfiling units), the number of taxable 
returns, the number of returns with itemized deductions, and 
the amount of tax liability.
    Table 3 provides distributional estimates by income class 
for some of the tax expenditures that affect individual 
taxpayers. Not all tax expenditures that affect individuals are 
shown in this table because of the difficulty in making 
reliable estimates of the income distribution of items that do
