While\r\nexcluded from income taxes, the fair rental value or cash housing/furnishing\r\nallowance is subject to Social Security payroll taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Impact</h4>\r\n<p>As a result of the special exclusion provided for parsonage allowances,\r\nministers receiving such housing allowances pay less tax than other\r\ntaxpayers with the same or smaller economic incomes. The tax benefit of the\r\nexclusion also provides a disproportionately greater benefit to relatively\r\nbetter-paid ministers, by virtue of the higher marginal tax rates applicable to\r\ntheir incomes.</p>\r\n<p>Further, some ministers claim income tax deductions for housing costs\r\nallocable to the receipt of tax-free allowances.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rationale</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The provision of tax-free housing allowances for ministers was first made\r\na part of the Internal Revenue Code by passage of the Revenue Act of 1921\r\n(P.L. 98 of the 67th Congress), without any stated reason. The original\r\nrationale may reflect the difficulty of placing a value on the provision of a\r\nchurch-provided rectory. Since some churches provided rectories to their\r\nministers as part of their compensation, while other churches provided a\r\nhousing allowance, Congress may have wished to provide equal tax\r\ntreatment to both groups. Another suggested rationale is that originally the\r\nprovision was provided in recognition of the clergy as an economically\r\ndeprived group with low incomes.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>The Internal Revenue Service reversed a 1962 ruling (Ruling 62-212) in\r\n1983 (Revenue Ruling 83-3) providing that, to the extent of the tax-free\r\nhousing allowance, deductions for interest and property taxes may not be\r\nitemized as a tax deduction. This change was based on the belief that it was\r\nunfair to allow tax-free income to be used to generate individual itemized\r\ndeductions to shelter taxable income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514), Congress reversed the IRS\r\nruling because the tax treatment had been long-standing, and some Members\r\nwere concerned that the IRS might treat tax-free housing allowances\r\nprovided to U.S. military personnel similarly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internal Revenue Service\u2019s position (Revenue Ruling 71-280) is that\r\nthe exclusion may not exceed the fair rental value of the home plus the cost\r\nof utilities. The Tax Court held that amounts used to provide a home are\r\nexcludable even if the amount received exceeds the fair market rental value\r\nof the home (Richard D. Warren, et ux. v. Commissioner; 114 T.C. No. 23\r\n(May 16, 2000)). In that case, 100 percent of compensation was designated\r\nas a housing allowance ($77,663 in 1993, $76,309 in 1994, and $84,278 in\r\n1995). The court dismissed the IRS\u2019s argument that its position prevents\r\nunequal treatment between ministers for whom housing is provided and\r\nexcluded and those ministers receiving a rental allowance. That decision\r\nwas appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which directed parties\r\nto submit briefs on whether the court should address the constitutionality of\r\nthe parsonage exclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to forestall action by the Ninth Circuit by making the underlying\r\nissue in the Warren case moot, Congress clarified the parsonage housing tax\r\nallowance with passage of the Clergy Housing Allowance Clarification Act\r\nof 2002 (P.L. 107-181). In large part Congress adopted the more\r\nconservative IRS position such that the \u201callowance does not exceed the fair\r\nrental value of the home, including furnishings and appurtenances such as a\r\ngarage, plus the cost of utilities.\u201d The Act says that it is intended to\r\n\u201cminimize government intrusion into internal church operations and the\r\nrelationship between a church and its clergy\u201d and \u201crecognize that clergy\r\nfrequently are required to use their homes for purposes that would otherwise\r\nqualify for favorable tax treatment, but which may require more intrusive\r\ninquiries by the government into the relationship between clergy and their\r\nrespective churches with respect to activities that are inherently religious.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\n<p>The tax-free parsonage allowances encourage some congregations to\r\nstructure maximum amounts of tax-free housing allowances into their\r\nminister\u2019s pay and may thereby distort the compensation package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provision is inconsistent with economic principles of horizontal and\r\nvertical equity. Since all taxpayers may not exclude amounts they pay for\r\nhousing from taxable income, the provision violates horizontal equity\r\nprinciples. For example, a clergyman teaching in an affiliated religious\r\nschool may exclude the value of his housing allowance whereas a teacher in\r\nthe same school may not. This example shows how the tax law provides\r\ndifferent tax treatment to two taxpayers whose economic incomes may be\r\nsimilar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ministers with higher incomes receive a greater tax subsidy than lower-\r\nincome ministers because of their higher marginal tax rates. Vertical equity\r\nis a concept which requires that tax burdens be distributed fairly among\r\npeople with different abilities to pay. The disproportionate benefit of the tax\r\nexclusion to individuals with higher incomes reduces the progressivity of the\r\ntax system, which is viewed as a reduction in equity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ministers who have church-provided homes do not receive the same tax\r\nbenefits as those who purchase their homes and also have the tax deductions\r\nfor interest and property taxes available to them. Code Section 265\r\ndisallows deductions for interest and expenses which relate to tax-exempt\r\nincome except in the case of military housing allowances and the parsonage\r\nallowance. As such, this result is inconsistent with the general tax policy\r\nprinciple of preventing double tax benefits.</p>\r\n", "locked": 0, "page": 66, "name": "Exclusion of Housing Allowances for Ministers"}}, {"pk": 135, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p>Not every contract represents a subsidy.

Given these limitations, we present all federal spending on grants that can be found, as it is the upper bound of what might potentially be a subsidy to nonprofits for these programs. However, as previously mentioned, many programs are missing from federal data bases, or may not be accurately reported as having gone to a nonprofit, and are therefore not counted. Further, Subsidyscope does not include payments made through the Medicare or Medicaid programs that indirectly benefit nonprofit health care providers.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a> Subsidyscope will present more detail on these two programs when we examine the health care sector. \n\n<p><a href=\"/nonprofits/direct-expenditures/search/\">Click here</a> to explore Subsidyscope's grants database.</p>\n\n<h4>Subsidies through Contracts</h4>\n\n<p>In addition to grants, the government contracts with nonprofits to provide services for the government, either on behalf of the government or for the government directly. Under a contract, a subsidy generally occurs when the government pays more than fair market value for a good or service&mdash;a situation that is relatively unusual. While it may not always be clear that a contract <em>does not</em> include a subsidy, it is sometimes clear that a contract <em>does</em> include a subsidy component. For example, federal procurement rules explicitly favor certain types of businesses, such as those that are minority-owned, and certain types of goods, such as recycled paper. But, in many cases it is difficult to determine when a subsidy is included as the fair market value may be a matter of opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope does not attempt to determine which contracts have a subsidy component or measure what that component may be. We do presume, however, that competed contracts&mdash;contracts that are subject to an open bidding process&mdash;generally do not have a subsidy component, even though the bidding process may include certain preferences. Thus, we concentrate on those contracts that are non-competed and make this information available to the public. <em>This does not mean non-competed contracts contain a significant subsidy, only that it is more likely to be the case.</em> </p.\n\n<p><a href=\"/nonprofits/contracts/search/\">Click here</a> to explore Subsidyscope's contracts database.</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"/media/images/nonprofits/nonprofit_contracts.png\"/><br/>\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of data from USAspending.gov.</cite>\n</p>\n\n<h4>Detailed Scope and Methodology</h4>\n\n<p>In addition to examining federal spending data on USAspending.gov&mdash;which includes the Federal Assistance Awards Data System and the Federal Procurement Data System&mdash;government support for the nonprofit sector can be examined through Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filings. This information adds further context for understanding the sector\u2019s financial relationship with the government. Most nonprofit organizations submit financial data to the IRS every year, including how much money they received from government sources.  However, since this government funding includes all government sources, there is no easy way to determine what amount of money came from federal versus state and local governments. Even if a distinction could be made, some federal money is funneled to nonprofits indirectly through state and local governments and there is no simple way to determine how much of the state and local support may ultimately be coming from a federal source.   </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the IRS data provide useful information regarding the scope of the sector and the impact of funding from government sources. A survey by the Urban Institute of IRS filings found that federal, state and local governments provided $323 billion to nonprofits in 2005&mdash;nearly a third of all nonprofit revenue. Seventy percent of the revenue was spent on health care services. For nonprofits providing non-health related services, government funding accounted for 9 percent of all revenue.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a>  This estimate of government funding going to nonprofits is significantly higher than the estimate of federal funding from USAspending.gov. This discrepancy is, in part, because it includes state and local grants and contracts, as mentioned above, but the difference is further evidence that the USAspending.gov database may be missing significant information&mdash;an issue that Subsidyscope has <a href=\"/data-quality/\">previously written</a> about and will continue to examine.<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a> </p>\n\n\n<p>Subsidyscope\u2019s estimate of federal spending on grants to nonprofits includes an adjustment made to prevent a potentially large underestimation of grants going to nonprofits due to a constraint in USAspending.gov records. When reporting grant data, USAspending.gov requires agencies to select either \u201cnonprofit\u201d or \u201chigher education\u201d as recipient types. It does not allow both categories to be selected for the same grant. This choice presents a problem because many colleges and universities are also nonprofits. According to GAO, 95 percent of recipients labeled \u201chigher education\u201d in USAspending.gov are also nonprofits, but USAspending.gov records do not reflect this dual categorization.<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a>  To address this problem, Subsidyscope combines these categories in its analysis of the nonprofit sector, acknowledging that a small number of for-profit recipients will be included as a result&mdash;a method also used by GAO. The estimates are significantly affected by the treatment of this category. For instance, Subsidyscope estimates that in 2008 organizations labeled \u201chigher education\u201d accounted for 46 percent of all federal grants within the nonprofit sector, meaning that a significant portion of contracts within the sector would be missing if the \u201chigher education\u201d label were not included.<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Last updated May 26, 2010.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>Government Accountability Office (GAO), \u201c<a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-193\">Significant Federal Funds Reach the Sector through Various Mechanisms, but More Complete and Reliable Funding Data Are Needed</a>.\u201d February 2009.

OMB presents Treasury Department estimates based on current tax law as of December 31, 2008; future years are projections.</cite>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t \t\r\n\r\n<h4>The Deduction for Charitable Contributions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest tax subsidy that targets nonprofits is the deduction for charitable contributions. The federal government subsidizes donations to qualified charities by allowing taxpayers who itemize to deduct those donations from their pre-tax income.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4,5</a>   In fiscal year 2008, this tax subsidy cost the Treasury nearly $47 billion of revenue.<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This provision benefits nonprofits and taxpayers by lowering the cost of charitable giving. The amount of the tax subsidy rises with the taxpayer\u2019s marginal tax rate. For example, a taxpayer who is subject to a marginal rate of 25 percent and makes a donation of $1000 to a charity will save $250 on their taxes and, thus, only end up spending $750 in order to donate $1000, after the tax deduction. (Without the deduction, the taxpayer would have paid $250 more in taxes.) By comparison, using the same computation, a taxpayer subject to a marginal tax rate of 35 percent would spend $650 donating $1000 to a charity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taxpayers who claim this deduction share its benefit with the nonprofits to which they give. In order to determine what share of the benefit goes to nonprofits, one must know how much these taxpayers would have donated in the absence of the tax subsidy. Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to this question. Regardless, it is by far the largest federal tax expenditure targeted to nonprofits. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Exemption of Credit Union Income</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal and state chartered credit unions are typically organized around certain membership groups (e.g., employees of an organization) and do not operate to make a profit. Like other nonprofit organizations, credit unions are exempt from the federal income tax. However, the exemption of credit union income is considered a tax expenditure by the Treasury Department. This exemption cost the government $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2008<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a> and results in credit unions paying their members higher dividends on their deposits and charging them lower interest rates on loans.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a> More information on this tax subsidy can be found <a href=\"/nonprofits/tax-expenditures/credit-union-income/\">here</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tax-Exempt Bonds</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>State and local governments issue tax-exempt bonds.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a> Some of these bonds help finance activities or facilities often used by nonprofit organizations such as the construction of hospitals and nursing homes. This provides a subsidy because interest payments on the bonds are exempt from income tax. The bonds lower the nonprofit\u2019s costs because investors accept a lower rate of interest due to the tax benefit.  Thus, many bond buyers and nonprofits share the benefit from this tax subsidy.<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a> Government-issued tax-exempt bonds are generally not targeted at nonprofit organizations so Subsidyscope classifies them as incidentally benefiting the nonprofit sector and lists them in Table 2 below.<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a> </p.\r\n\r\n<p>One category of government-issued bonds specifically finances private nonprofit educational facilities such as classrooms and dormitories.<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a>  These bonds cost the government an estimated $860 million in lost revenue in 2008<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a> and are listed as a subsidy targeted at nonprofit organizations in Table 1. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Special Deduction for BlueCross BlueShield</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>BlueCross BlueShield initially received a special federal tax deduction because it provided community rated<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a> health insurance, including the provision of high-risk and small-group coverage.<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a> BlueCross BlueShield was a tax-exempt organization until that status was overturned by the Tax Reform Act of 1986; however, the special deduction was left in place. This deduction is estimated to have cost the Treasury approximately $620 million in FY 2008.<a href=\"#footnote-16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Exclusion of Housing Allowance for Ministers</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Expenditures on housing that churches provide to ministers are not taxable. An effect of this provision is that churches may be able to pay ministers a lower salary since their cost of housing is effectively reduced. In this sense, the tax exclusion benefits both the ministers\u2014who pay less income tax\u2014and the nonprofit churches they serve. The government subsidized churches and ministers through this exclusion in 2008 by foregoing $550 million of revenue.<a href=\"#footnote-17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Tax Subsidies Incidentally Benefiting Nonprofits </h4>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\" style=\"width:500px; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom:10px; float: right;\">\r\n<h5 style=\"margin-top:20px;\">Table 2: Selected Tax Expenditures That Incidentally Benefit Nonprofits (In Addition to Other Entities)</h5>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Exclusion of Employer Contributions for Medical Insurance Premiums and Medical Care</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Deductibility of Medical Expenses</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Self-Employed Medical Insurance Premiums</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">HOPE Tax Credit</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Lifetime Learning Tax Credit</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Exclusion of Scholarship and Fellowship Income</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Medical Savings Accounts/Health Savings Accounts</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Deduction for Higher Education Expenses</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Exclusion of Interest on Hospital Construction Bonds</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Deductibility of Student Loan Interest</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">State Prepaid Tuition Plans</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Exclusion of Employer-provided Educational Assistance</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Work Opportunity Tax Credit</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Adoption Credit and Exclusion</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Distributions for Retirement Plans for Premiums for Health and Long-Term Care Insurance</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Exclusion of Interest on Student Loan Bonds</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Special Deduction for Teacher Expenses</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Credit for Holders of Zone Academy Bonds</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Credit for Disabled Access Expenditures</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Education Individual Retirement Accounts</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Employee Retention Credit for employers in Certain Federal Disaster Areas</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Exclusion of interest on Savings Bonds Redeemed to Finance Educational Expenses</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Discharge of Student Loan Indebtedness</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\">Tax Credit for Health Insurance Purchased by Certain Displaced and Retired Individuals</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope compilation of data from  OMB. \u201cAnalytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2010.\u201d pp. 300 -302; 304.</cite>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of tax expenditures are targeted at certain types of services that are often, but not exclusively, provided by nonprofit organizations. In its report on federal funding of the nonprofit sector, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) discusses these other tax benefits.<a href=\"#footnote-18\" class=\"footnote\">18</a>  For example, GAO presents the exclusion of employer contributions for medical insurance premiums and medical care from a company\u2019s taxable income, which subsidizes both nonprofit and for-profit health care providers as well as employees. Unfortunately, there are no reliable estimates on how much this, or other such tax subsidies, directly subsidize nonprofits. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>GAO presents a short list of tax expenditures that benefit nonprofits as well as other entities;  however, GAO emphasizes that it did not attempt to identify all tax expenditures that benefit nonprofits. Subsidyscope begins with GAO\u2019s list, and further identifies other tax expenditures for which some of the benefit flows to nonprofits. While Subsidyscope does not include these subsidies in the overall estimate of subsidies the nonprofit sector receives, users of this site should be aware of these large non-targeted tax provisions that can incidentally, but significantly, benefit the nonprofit sector. Table 2 below provides a list of such tax expenditures. The scope of this table is limited to tax expenditures for activities presented by the OMB as falling in the budget functions \u201cEducation, Training, Employment, and Social Services\u201d and \u201cHealth.\u201d Nonprofits performing activities in these two areas comprise about 64 percent<a href=\"#footnote-19\" class=\"footnote\">19</a> of all nonprofits, 88 percent of the sector\u2019s revenues and 82 percent of its assets.<a href=\"#footnote-20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Tax Exempt Status of Sector</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope defines the nonprofit sector as any organization exempt from federal taxation under subsection 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Service code.<a href=\"#footnote-21\" class=\"footnote\">21</a>  This includes so-called 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) organizations such as religious institutions, charities, civic organizations and private foundations. <a href=\"/nonprofits/summary/\">Click here</a> to read Subsidyscope\u2019s Summary of the Nonprofit Sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the nonprofit sector is exempt from federal income taxes, Subsidyscope does not consider tax exemption for nonprofits a federal subsidy. This is for two reasons. First, the exemption was not conceived as a tax subsidy. The tax exemption was originally an attempt to define the corporate income tax base and determine which activities of traditional nonprofit organizations should remain outside the sphere of government. As such, the tax exemption does not constitute a subsidy because the income from the non-business activities of nonprofit organizations was never intended to be taxed in the first place.<a href=\"#footnote-22\" class=\"footnote\">22</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the federal government does not recognize the exemption as a tax expenditure. Neither the Office of Management and Budget nor Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation list the sector\u2019s tax-exempt status as a tax expenditure, thus neither of these entities estimate the amount of revenue lost from the tax exemption. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, attempts have been made at estimating the sector\u2019s untaxed revenue. For example, an Urban Institute study estimated that the potentially taxable income of public charities was $25.4 billion in 2002, the equivalent to an income tax savings to nonprofits (and a loss to the government) of $10.1 billion.<a href=\"#footnote-23\" class=\"footnote\">23</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Last updated May 26, 2010.</em></p>\r\n \t \t \t \r\n\r\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\r\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>This number derived by adding up the tax expenditures listed in the 2008 column of Table 1.

Subsidyscope\u2019s review of federal data shows that at least $7 billion in loans, through 12 federal direct loan programs and $284 million in loan guarantees, through four federal programs, went to nonprofits in fiscal year 2008, providing subsidies of at least $96 million and $18 million respectively.<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a> <p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope refers to this method of providing subsidies as a \u201crisk transfer.\u201d By transferring risk from others to itself, the federal government encourages people to undertake activities they may not otherwise carry out. Such risk transfers are typically accomplished through government credit and insurance programs, such as the student loan program and federal deposit insurance.</p>\n\n<p>The extent of a subsidy received under a credit or insurance program generally is the difference between the terms the recipient would get in a competitive market and those offered by the government. (See the discussion <a href=\"/loans/\">here</a> for more detail on federal credit and insurance programs.) Federal direct loans and loan guarantees often operate similarly to tax expenditures in that there are multiple beneficiaries of this type of subsidy. </p>\n\n<p>Some nonprofit organizations receive federal loans directly. For instance, nonprofit electric utilities receive loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Development Electric Program (listed as Rural Electrification Loans and Loan Guarantees in Table 1 below). In other cases, the nonprofit may be a lender and the federal government guarantees payment of the loan on behalf of the borrower. For example, if a nonprofit organization provides a loan for a low-income family to buy a home and that loan is guaranteed by the federal government, it contains a subsidy. In both of these cases, the risk transfer benefits both the nonprofit and the family that receives the home paid for with a government guarantee.</p>\n\n<p>Collecting federal data on risk transfer programs that benefit nonprofits is not a straightforward task.  A recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) analysis indicates that records found at USAspending.gov for risk transfer programs are of particularly poor quality. GAO notes that amounts of loans or loan guarantees may not be consistently captured, federal agency staff may not be consistently marking funds as going to nonprofits and there may be missing data.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a>  For example, GAO notes that some agencies only report loan guarantees when a default occurs,<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a>  which is a practice that will clearly lead to an understatement of federal subsidy costs.</p>\n\n<p>Based on GAO\u2019s assessment and our own analysis, Subsidyscope considers the results we present to underestimate the cost of subsidies provided to nonprofit organizations. First, the government does not include the cost of administering the loan (though this cost is accounted for elsewhere in the budget, it is not included in the subsidy cost of the credit). Second, the government\u2014using methods required under credit reform legislation\u2014does not include the cost of risk when calculating net present value. (See the discussion <a href=\"/loans/\">here</a> on how the government calculates loan subsidies.) Further, Subsidyscope does not include loans or loan guarantees for students attending higher education institutions that may indirectly benefit nonprofit educational institutions, nonprofit third party lenders and nonprofit guarantors of student loans. (Subsidyscope will present more detail on student loans and loan guarantees when we examine the Education Sector in 2011.)</p>\n\n<p>Table 1 below provides a list of programs through which the federal government made direct loans and loan guarantees to nonprofit organizations in fiscal year 2008. Tables 2 and 3 provide the number of loans or guarantees in each program, the total amount of those loans or guarantees and the government estimate of the total subsidy involved. Subsidyscope provides these data because they are the best available federal data on government risk transfers benefitting the nonprofit sector.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\" style=\"margin-top:

According to the Treasury Department, additional TARP funds will be made available through FY2010 under the Home Affordable Modification Program, an incentive program for banks that refinances loans for troubled homeowners.\n<p>\n<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 <a href\"=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h1enr.pdf#page=402\">changed</a> the terms of TARP contracts to which banks had originally agreed for receiving TARP disbursements, allowing them to repay funds much earlier than called for in the initial contract.  In September 2009, <a href=\"http://treas.gov/press/releases/docs/Next Phase of Financial Policy, Final, 2009-09-14.pdf\">Treasury projected</a> that financial institutions would repay another $50 billion over the next 12 to 18 months beyond the more than $70 billion in repayments already received as of that date.  However, repayments have exceeded that projection; as of April 21, 2010, <a href\"=http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/tg650.htm\">Treasury announced</a> that TARP repayments already totaled $186 billion. In that same release, Treasury noted that less than $200 billion in TARP disbursements remain outstanding. </p>\n\n\n<p><strong>March 2, 2009</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>This page is your gateway to information on the TARP transactions. Subsidyscope has gathered data on each transaction under the TARP program. The following table shows which companies received funds, how much they received, and when they received it.  Detailed data on individual transactions can be downloaded into a spreadsheet, and the visualizations provide a quick view of the transactions over time, by recipient and by date.</p>\n\n\t<p>Although the government has provided a few companies with loans under TARP, nearly all the transactions have been purchases of equity stakes in those companies.  In exchange for funding from TARP, the government usually receives preferred stock and warrants from the company. For information on the value of warrants purchased through TARP, including daily stock prices, <a href=\"{% url tarp-warrants %}\">click here</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p>The amount of funding provided through a TARP transaction can be found in the \"Disbursements Received\" column of the table (this corresponds to what the Treasury Department calls \"Prices Paid\" in its publications). The table also includes information on the size of those companies, as measured by their assets.</p>\n\n\t<p>A crucial piece of information needed to calculate the subsidies provided through TARP is the amount of funding provided to a company.  But it is not a measure of the subsidy itself.  To calculate the subsidies, the market value of the preferred stock, warrants, and loans must be deducted from the funding provided to the institution.  Although information on the subsidies to individual companies through TARP is still quite limited, some data can be found <a href=\"{% url tarp-subsidies %}\">here</a>.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Treasury began receiving dividend payments in December 2008. Institutions make payments on a quarterly basis at a rate of at least 5 percent of their annual profits; the rate ultimately will increase to 9 percent. Treasury is currently releasing dividend reports on a monthly basis. The reports can be found on the Subsidyscope <a href=\"/projects/bailout/documents/\">key documents</a> page. </p>\n\n<p>Financial institutions can repay TARP funds only with the approval of the Treasury Department and their federal banking regulator, the regulator having the final say. Banks that wish to repay TARP funds must prove that they have adequate capital to continue lending to creditworthy borrowers. The 19 financial institutions that underwent the <a href=\"http://federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20090601b.htm\">Supervisory Capital Assessment Program</a>, better known as the  \u201cstress tests,\u201d must also prove they can sustain healthy levels of capital into the future.

Most commonly, agencies will seek comments for proposed rules at least 30 days before they publish the proposal in the <i>Federal Register</i> \u2013 the daily official publication of federal rules, proposed rules and notices. Agencies take the comments into consideration before passing a final rule that will ultimately appear in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. Final rules can also be amended using the same process.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut the case of the Legacy Loans Program, one arm of the Treasury Department's newly-announced Public-Private Investment Program, is unusual. The program was created under an emergency provision in the FDIC charter that allows the Treasury secretary to determine whether there is a systemic risk to the economy. Using the provision, the FDIC can take action to avoid or mitigate systemic risk. So while the FDIC isn't bound to hold a comment process, the agency has chosen to do so to hear from the public on the program.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Legacy Loans Program</b>\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Legacy Loans Program is aimed at getting rid of troubled assets and loans held by banks across the country. The market for many troubled assets, the root of the current economic crisis, has collapsed and the value of those assets has fallen sharply. The Treasury Department and the FDIC created the Public-Private Investment Program to rebuild that market, which would allow banks to sell those assets, free up capital and increase lending.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe government explored the option of purchasing the troubled assets directly, but officials felt that any price set would be too high. Instead, under the $500 billion to $1 trillion Legacy Loans Program, Treasury will partner with private investors by creating joint Public-Private Investment Funds that will pay for the troubled assets.\r\n</p><p>\r\nUnder the program, the Public-Private Investment Funds would purchase troubled assets from the banks with financing from the Treasury, private investors and the FDIC.  The Treasury Department and private investors would contribute equal amounts of equity financing; the rest of the financing would come from debt that was guaranteed by the FDIC.  The debt guaranteed by the FDIC will be determined by the assets themselves, but it cannot exceed 6 times the amount of equity contributed by the Treasury and private investors.  The FDIC would charge the funds a fee for the guarantee.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPotential investors in the funds may include a wide range of institutions, including mutual funds, pension plans, insurance companies, financial institutions, individuals, publicly managed investment funds, private equity funds, hedge funds and other long-term investors.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIf a fund turns a profit, its returns are split equally between private investors and the government. However, if a fund loses money, the loss is first absorbed by the equity contributed by the Treasury and the private investors, and if those contributions are insufficient to cover the loss, the remainder is absorbed by the FDIC. Although private investors fully share the potential profit gains with the government, any losses are only limited to their initial equity contribution. The government bears most of the downside risk.\r\n</p><p>\r\nProponents of the funds argue that the participation of private investors will help restart the market for troubled assets and help reveal the true prices of those assets.  Critics, however, note that because private investors bear little downside risk, the funds will end up paying too much for those troubled assets.

In its request, it outlined 17 questions, relating to everything from what type of asset should be sold, to whether the identities of participating investors should be made public.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRespondents suggested changes. Some drew diagrams. There were rants, and there were displays of gratitude, and cautiousness. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\"We are grateful for the opportunity to comment on this program and look forward to helping the LLP be successful and beneficial for taxpayers, our communities, the federal government and the banking industry,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp270.pdf\">Joe Brannen</a>, the President and CEO of the Georgia Bankers Association, which represents more than 350 commercial banks and thrifts.\r\n</p><p> \r\n\"In our view, this could be an important tool for removing troubled loans that are prevent some of our member banks from supporting new lending in communities throughout Georgia.\"\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn contrast, a blogger known as <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp391.pdf\">Dr. Housing Bubble</a> cautioned the FDIC not to go through with the program.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\"You are the absolute last line of defense from giving out a massive $500 billion to $1 trillion in handouts to perpetrators of this financial crisis\u2026 the program is marketed as a public and private partnership, but the massive downside potential is falling on the shoulders of the taxpayers,\" the blogger wrote. \"In the end, taxpayers are fronting nearly 93 percent of the risk\u2026 When these loans start failing, as they will, the FDIC will suddenly become one of the biggest toxic mortgage holders... It is a recipe for another disaster.\"\r\n</p><p>\r\nOther comments offered tacit approval but cautioned the FDIC to tread carefully. <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp418.pdf\">Mark J. Tenhundfeld</a>, director of regulatory policy at the American Bankers Association, said that his organization was concerned about the FDIC's \"mission creep.\"\r\n</p><p>\r\n\"The FDIC must not allow itself to become extended in activities beyond its traditional role of deposit insurer that in any way detract from\u2026 its primary and paramount deposit insurance responsibilities,\" Tenhundfeld wrote.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTenhundfeld also recommended that banks be allowed to purchase pooled troubled assets of other banks to increase the number of bidders and the chance that such assets would be sold.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBank of America's deputy general counsel, <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp219.pdf\">Gregory A. Baer</a>, asked that the FDIC assure private investors that \"once the core terms of the program are established, neither the FDIC nor the government bodies will engage in undue efforts to change the terms of the program. The financial community has witnessed punitive modifications to other government programs after they had been established, creating uncertainty and discouraging participation.\"\r\n</p><p>\r\nBaer also asked for the auctioned assets to include corporate loans, construction loans and revolving credit facilities \u2013 and not just real estate assets.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn contrast, a non-profit organization, the <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/llp/comments/llp132.pdf\">Center for Responsible Lending</a>, recommended that the assets only include residential real estate assets, which are the source of the crisis.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe center also asked the FDIC to include President Obama's Home Affordable Modification Program, which expands the eligibility of home borrowers, in the Legacy Loans Program. It recommended that all loans and related assets sold or acquired through the LLP be subject to HAMP, and all institutions that sell loans or other assets through the program be required to participate in HAMP.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>The Question of Transparency</b>\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne of the FDIC's questions to commenters was whether they thought investors' identities should be made publicly available.

Collectively, they hold $1.3 trillion in assets and are the largest U.S. borrower after the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA Subsidyscope review of the FHLBs\u2019 financial statements has found that several of the banks are carrying substantial \"unrealized losses\" on their investments in mortgage-backed securities.  Because the banks believe these losses are temporary, they don\u2019t have to be recognized on the banks\u2019 accounting statements. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nWhat\u2019s potentially worrisome is the sheer size of the losses. For the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle, they are substantially larger than the capital the bank holds to protect itself against such declines. If its mortgage-backed securities don\u2019t regain their value, the bank will have to write them down, which could wipe out its capital buffer and raise risks for taxpayers. </p>\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\nA PUBLIC MISSION\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>The FLHBs' mission is to keep home loans flowing by borrowing money and lending it to the banks and other institutions that issue the loans. The system works as a cooperative: there are 12 regional banks, and they serve their members \u2013 8,100 commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, and insurance companies across the country. The FHLBs can borrow cheaply because investors believe that, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government won't let them fail. The home loan banks are especially helpful to community banks and small thrifts because these smaller institutions typically find it more difficult to raise capital themselves. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe troubles began when several FHLBs invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities created by Wall Street.   As the housing crisis developed, these investments lost a good deal of their value.  A Subsidyscope review of the banks' annual reports found that in the first three months of 2009 alone, several FHLBs saw the ratings of a large portion of these securities decline from AAA to junk status, most notably the Boston, San Francisco and Seattle banks. A downgrade to junk doesn\u2019t mean the securities are worthless, and an improvement in the market could increase their value. Still, the downgrades were numerous. The San Francisco bank, for example, saw $7 billion of its private mortgage-backed securities go to junk (see graphic below).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Article continues after graphic)</p>", "locked": 0, "page": 8, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 28, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<h4>April 29, 2010 \u2014 TARP Estimates Lowered</h4>\n<p>On January 29, 2010, <a href\"=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10871/01-26-Outlook.pdf\">CBO released</a> dramatically lower estimates of the total costs of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) than those originally released.

href=\"http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=231\">recently highlighted in a blog post </a>that the agency sharply increased its estimates of the projected subsidies provided by the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to $356 billion, up from the January estimate of $189 billion. The new estimates nearly double the total subsidy rate for TARP from 27 percent to 51 percent. The subsidy estimates represent the net cost to the government based on the expected return on the initial investment into financial institutions. In its <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/100xx/doc10014/03-20-PresidentBudget.pdf\">March report</a>, CBO explains that the revised estimates result from three factors, including \"changes in financial market conditions, new transactions, and a small shift in the anticipated timing of disbursements.\"</p>\n<p>CBO notes that market yields on securities issued by the firms that have received TARP funds have increased since the time of its last estimate, and this has boosted the estimated subsidy cost of Treasury's purchases of preferred stock, asset guarantees and loans. CBO's earlier analysis assumed a larger range of companies having smaller subsidy rates (<a href=\"{% url tarp-subsidies %}\">see these examples</a>); however, a few companies (such as AIG) ended up receiving larger disbursements than previously estimated. Further, CBO's new estimates reflect its assumption that more transactions will take place in FY 2010 (after October 2009) than had previously been projected, which shifts costs to 2010.</p>", "locked": 0, "page": 9, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 30, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<div class=\"content_area\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>April 29, 2010 \u2014 New Estimates of Subsidy to Fannie and Freddie</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Subsidyscope has reported previously, most of the cost of subsidizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was incurred when the government put the two institutions into conservatorship in fiscal year 2009.

Using numbers from the <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/97xx/doc9706/09-08-Update.pdf\">Congressional Budget Office (CBO)</a>, Subsidyscope finds that the projected costs of subsidizing Fannie and Freddie exceed the aggregate subsidies provided by the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which are expected to total $356 billion over the same 2009-2019 period. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises that purchase mortgages and guarantee pools of mortgages. TARP is a U.S. Treasury program that purchases preferred stock and warrants from banks and other financial institutions, provides asset guarantees and makes loans to automotive companies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMost of the cost of subsidizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was incurred when the government put the two institutions into conservatorship. However, the government faces additional and ongoing subsidy costs that stem from the two GSEs\u2019 new business after the takeover. In January 2009, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/89xx/doc8917/01-23-2008_BudgetOutlook.pdf\">CBO estimated</a> that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would receive $309 billion of subsidies between 2009 and 2019. Since January, CBO has raised the total subsidy cost over that period by $80 billion. The upward revision stems from a deterioration of the two GSEs' financial condition.\r\n</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t", "locked": 0, "page": 10, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 31, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<h4>April 29, 2010</h4>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: The following text and charts are estimates based on the information available at the time they were made and do not reflect updated data.

In practice, however, the government would not choose to exercise that right so the payoff to the government from an out-of-the-money option is zero. That does not necessarily mean that the warrant is worthless.  Because stock prices move up or down every day, there is always a chance that the stock price could move above the strike price at some point in the future before the expiration date of the warrant. The Special Inspector General for TARP (SIGTARP) notes that it is not unusual for warrants to be \"out of the money\" when they are issued.

After a bank repays its CPP funds to Treasury, it has the option to repurchase its warrants, as in the  previously mentioned case with Old National Bancorp. When a bank chooses to repurchase its warrants, the bank has 15 days to negotiate an estimate of fair market value with Treasury.  The bank must follow Treasury\u2019s valuation process, which uses four inputs: comparable market data, warrant pricing models (such as Black-Scholes), fundamental company analysis and an outside consultant\u2019s appraisal.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></p>\n\n<p>If a bank chooses not to repurchase its warrants, Treasury may then dispose of warrants by selling them to a third party in a private sale or through a public auction.

However, COP also notes that the rate of return earned by Treasury on these transactions (12 percent) is likely to be higher than the average rate it will receive on rest of the warrants, given that the early repaying banks were among the healthiest of the TARP recipient banks.<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a>  COP reports that in its conversations with Treasury representatives about the valuation of the warrants, they sought \u201ccorrect and reasonable valuation[s], not valuation[s] that [would] maximize taxpayer returns.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a></p>\n\n\n<h4>March 25, 2009</h4>\n\n<p>The Special Inspector General overseeing the Department of Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) presents data on the warrants that taxpayers now hold as a result of the government's bailout of financial institutions.

Because the warrants have value, they offset some of the costs to the government of providing TARP funds to the companies.  The less the warrants are worth, the larger the net (subsidy) costs to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The value of the warrants is determined by many factors, but one of the most important factors is the difference between the price of the company's stock and the strike price of the warrant.  If the stock price is above the strike price, the government can make money. If the stock price is below the strike price, however, the government does not make any money by exercising the warrant. In other words, the higher the strike price, the lower the value of the warrants to the government--and the larger the net subsidy cost to the government. <a href=\"{% url tarp-warrants %}\">Subsidyscope presents a table</a> providing data on the Treasury's warrant purchases, and their daily payoff based on current stock prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury Department describes its policies on pricing TARP warrants in both press releases and an accompanying <a href=\"http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/reports/termsheet.pdf\">term sheet on its Web site</a>.

In the actual contracts signed between Treasury and companies receiving TARP funds, the strike price is apparently calculated using the average of closing prices on the 20 trading days before the company applied for the TARP funds.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>The two methods can result in significantly different strike prices.  Because stock prices of many financial companies have been declining, the strike price calculated at the time of application is generally higher than the price would have been if it was calculated at the execution of the contract when the investment is made.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Take the Treasury's injection of funds into Bank of America (BAC) on October 28, 2008, for instance.  In return, the government received warrants with a strike price of $30.79, which is the 20-day average of closing stock prices before BAC applied for TARP.

Retrieved from http://subsidyscope.org.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"question\">Why is a database needed?</p>\r\n<p class=\"answer\">Given the influence subsidies exert on the American economy and the federal budget, there is a fundamental need for a comprehensive source of information on subsidy programs and policies. In order to monitor government spending, citizens, researchers, and policy makers must have information on the full extent of what government does, and where their money goes. </p>\r\n<p class=\"question\">Where is Subsidyscope\u2019s data?</p>\r\n<p class=\"answer\">Subsidyscope consolidates information from fragmented government data sources.\u00a0 We are constantly collecting more data to fill existing gaps and improve accuracy.\u00a0 Our downloadable data sets are <a href=\"/data/\">here</a>. \u00a0Subsidyscope also presents summary statistics from our data sets for different economic sectors.\u00a0 We typically present summary information in four categories: \u00a0\u00a0\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Direct Expenditures including direct transfers of money, goods, or services such as cash grants but excluding contracts.</li>\r\n<li>Tax Expenditures which lower the taxes certain parties pay the federal government by allowing special tax exemptions, deductions or credits.</li>\r\n<li>Risk Transfers conveying financial risk to the federal government through insurance agreements, loans and loan guarantees and similar instruments. </li>\r\n<li>Government contracts where the government pays for a good or service that it directly benefits from.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"question\">I have a story idea, who can I contact?</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"answer\">See the <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a> page.</p>\r\n</div>", "locked": 0, "page": 18, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 49, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<style type=\"text/css\">\r\nul.bio_list li { margin-bottom: 10px;}\r\nul.publications * { font-size: 83%;

At the same time,\r\nOMB Watch launched <a href=\"http://www.fedspending.org/\">FedSpending.org</a>, which has proven invaluable to journalists, public interest organizations and citizens looking for\r\ninformation on more than $16.8 trillion in government spending \u2014 and serves as a model for how the government should implement its requirements to create a searchable website.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>In addition to his role at OMB Watch, Dr. Bass is an affiliated associate professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Public Policy Institute and also teaches in the Nonprofit\r\nManagement Executive Certificate program at Georgetown\u2019s Center for Public and Nonprofit Leadership. He has served on numerous boards and has been an advisor to many organizations\r\nincluding the Advocacy Evaluation Project at Innovation Network, Center for Lobbying in the Public Interest, Coalition on Human Needs, Hampshire Research Institute, Loka Institute,\r\nNational Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, OpentheGovernment.org, the Science and Environment Health Network, and the Center on Government Secrecy at American University\u2019s\r\nWashington College of Law.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Prior to founding OMB Watch, Dr. Bass was president of the Human Services Information Center where he wrote two books and numerous articles on human services issues and published the\r\nHuman Services INSIDER, a bimonthly newsletter on the politics of federal human services programs.

Together, these acquisitions allow the center to produce some of the most sophisticated calculations done anywhere in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>In addition to acquiring analytical models, Beach helps build them. He was instrumental in developing the state-of-the-art econometric models Heritage uses to estimate in detail\r\nhow proposed tax changes will likely affect individuals, families, and various business sectors-as well as the overall national economy. Indeed, the center has become the leading\r\nproponent of dynamic scoring, which shows how much federal revenues change when the U.S. economy reacts to a tax increase or a tax cut.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Under Beach\u2019s direction, the center has progressed to the point that it regularly competes with the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, the Joint\r\nCommittee on Taxation, or any other government agency when it comes to \u201cscoring\u201d potential costs and benefits of legislation. Indeed, federal lawmakers often ask the center\r\nto analyze legislation they have drafted, knowing they can get a reliable estimate more quickly from the CDA than from any Capitol Hill agency.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Prior to joining Heritage in 1995, Beach held a variety of posts in the public, private and academic sectors. He served as a litigation economist with two Kansas City, Mo., law\r\nfirms-Campbell &amp; Bysfield and Watson, Ess, Marshall &amp; Enggas \u2013 where he specialized in analyzing how anti-trust legal remedies would alter product pricing and availability.\r\nLater, as an economist for Missouri\u2019s Office of Budget and Planning, he designed and managed the state\u2019s econometric model and advised the governor on revenue and economic\r\nissues. After a stint in the corporate headquarters of Sprint United Inc., Beach moved to the Washington, D.C., area to serve as president of the Institute for Humane Studies at George\r\nMason University.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>A graduate of Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., Beach also holds a master\u2019s degree in history and economics from the University of Missouri-Columbia.

To better coordinate the government's transportation activities, in 1966, President Johnson created the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).  Today DOT houses various government transportation programs, such as the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Highway Trust Fund and the U.S. Maritime Administration. Altogether DOT includes 13 sub-agencies covering a range of transportation modes, such as: aviation, highways, maritime, motor carriers, pipeline safety, and public transit and railroads.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dot.gov/about_dot.html\">DOT's mission</a> is to \"serve the United States by ensuring a fast, safe, efficient, accessible and convenient transportation system that meets our vital national interests and enhances the quality of life of the American people, today and into the future.\"  Expanding on this mission, <a href=\"http://www.dot.gov/budget/2010/bib2010.pdf\">DOT's strategic goals</a> (PDF) are to: <em>\"improve safety; protect the environment; support national security, preparedness and response; reduce congestion for all Americans; and increase global transportation connectivity in support of the Nation's Economy.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>In addition to the DOT's programs, the federal government carries out some transportation-related activities through the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the U.S. Coast Guard and other programs for transportation security. The Export-Import Bank of the United States, which helps finance the exports of American goods and services, is also active in the transportation sector. In fiscal 2008, <a href=\"http://www.exim.gov/about/reports/ar/ar2008/documents/Financial%20Report/AuthorizationsListings.pdf\">it guaranteed nearly $5.7 billion in long-term, transportation-related loans in 17 countries</a>, mostly for commercial aircraft.</p>\n\n<h4>Government Funding of Transportation Services</h4>\n<p>Subsidyscope examines four different categories of government subsidies, which are based on how the federal government delivers subsidies to recipients.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><a href=\"{% url transportation-direct-expenditures %}\">Direct expenditures</a> include direct transfers of money (e.g. cash grants) or goods and services (e.g., donation of government surplus).  This does not include contracts for goods and services which are covered in a separate category below.</li>\n\n  <li><a href=\"{% url transportation-tax-expenditures %}\">Tax expenditures</a> provide tax relief to certain parties by allowing special tax exemptions, deductions, credits or exclusions of income. </li>\n\n  <li><a href=\"{% url transportation-risk-transfers %}\">Risk transfers</a> convey financial risk to the federal government through insurance contracts, loans, loan guarantees and similar instruments. </li>\n\n  <li>Government <a href=\"{% url transportation-direct-expenditures %}\">contracts</a> may also be used to encourage or change market behavior by paying for goods or services at prices above fair market value.  For instance, the federal procurement system includes preferences for everything from alternative fuel vehicles to minority-owned businesses.</li>\n</ol><p class=\"inline-image floatr\"><img src=\"/media/images/transportation/piechart_DE_overview.png\"/><br /><cite style=\"width:330px;display:block;\">*Appropriations figures were substituted for missing rail data. Does not include Maritime spending from 2000-2004.</cite></p>\n\n<p>It is important to note two things about these categories.  First, they are not exhaustive.  The federal government uses other tools to provide subsidies, notably regulations, tariffs and negative subsidies (such as excise taxes), but Subsidyscope currently focuses on the four categories described above. Second, not all government spending is subsidy spending, and not all spending on subsidy programs counts as a subsidy.  The actual subsidy a recipient receives is the net benefit they receive from the program.  The cost of administering a subsidy program, for instance, does not directly benefit a recipient.</p>\n\n<p>In general, federal spending on the transportation sector is dominated by direct expenditures. In FY08, the federal government spent $42.7 billion on grants and other direct expenditures (excluding contracts) for transportation related activities.

Adding up the Department of Treasury's estimates &mdash; which are presented by the Office of Management and Budget in the President's Budget &mdash; results in a total of approximately $3.7 billion in revenue foregone due to transportation related tax expenditures in fiscal year 2008, as listed below: </p>\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\">\n<table>\n<tbody style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<tr class=\"header-row\"><td colspan=\"2\" class=\"first\" style=\"text-align:center;\">Table 1: Transportation related tax expenditures (fiscal year 2008)</td></tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>Exclusion of reimbursed employee parking expenses</td>\n    <td class=\"amount\">$2,920 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>Exclusion for employer-provided transit passes</td>\n    <td class=\"amount\">$480 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>Tax credit for certain expenditures for maintaining railroad tracks</td>\n    <td class=\"amount\">$180 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>Exclusion of interest on bonds for financing of highway projects and rail truck transfer facilities</td>\n    <td class=\"amount\">$80 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>Deferral of tax on shipping companies</td>\n    <td class=\"amount\">$20 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>Total </td>\n    <td class=\"amount\">$3,680 million</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<cite>\nSource: <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">The President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2010, Analytical Perspectives</a>; The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation also produces <a href=\"/projects/transportation/tax-expenditures/\">tax expenditure</a> estimates using slightly different assumptions; their estimates for the transportation tax expenditures are very similar.\n</cite>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p>Tax expenditure data presented are estimates of revenue forgone. They represent the lost revenue attributable\nto the use of the provision, which is not necessarily the same as what would be raised if the tax expenditure was\nrepealed. Summing tax expenditures does not account for the potential interactions among different types of taxes; however, it provides a reasonably good estimate of the total cost to the Treasury of the tax expenditures that are specifically targeted to the transportation sector.  The repeal of any single tax expenditure can trigger behavioral \neffects that in turn affect other tax expenditure amounts or even the total amount of tax revenue flowing into the \nTreasury. For example, if the tax expenditure favoring employee parking is repealed, more taxpayers may take the \ntax expenditure for employee transit passes, thus increasing the estimate for that tax expenditure.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Analytical_Perspectives/\">The President's Budget for fiscal year 2010</a> estimates that transportation related loans and loan guarantees were about $1 billion in 2008 &mdash; with a subsidy of $154 million. For 2009, the projections are higher, at $3.7 billion in loans and loan guarantees, of which $266 million is a subsidy.

Contracts differ from other direct expenditures, such as grants, because the government directly benefits from fulfillment of the contract.  For example, the government would use a contract to build housing for U.S. troops but might use a grant to build a homeless shelter.  The U.S. government directly benefits when the troops are sheltered, but, no matter how desirable, does not directly benefit from the homeless being sheltered.</p>\n\n<p>Under a contract, a subsidy generally occurs when the government pays more than fair market value for a good or service. Subsidies may also be provided to companies that have a preferred status in the bidding process. Government contracts have long been used as a method for subsidizing certain activities the government encourages.  For instance, in the 1840s the government wanted to support the development of oceangoing steamships, a relatively new technology at the time.  This resulted in Congress offering padded Post Office contracts to shipping companies if they used steamships to deliver the mail.</p><p class=\"inline-image floatl\"><img src=\"/media/images/transportation/graphs/fpds_noncomp_trans.png\" /><br /><cite>Source: <a href=\"http://www.usaspending.gov/fpds/index.php?reptype=a\">USAspending.gov</a></cite></p>\n<p>More often than not, however, a government contract is just a government contract and it does not have a subsidy component.  In some cases it is clear that a contract does include a subsidy component.  For example, federal procurement rules explicitly favor certain types of businesses, such as minority-owned businesses and certain types of goods, such as recycled paper. But in many cases it is difficult to determine when a subsidy is taking place since the fair market value may be a matter of opinion.  For example, as part of a trade dispute, the European Union claims Boeing, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, is receiving subsidies through \"overpriced DoD contracts.\"<sup>1</sup>  Boeing argues the \"payments represent the value of those services [rendered to the government].  They are not subsidies.\"<sup>2</sup>  It may be difficult to prove either side is correct.</p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope does not attempt to determine which contracts have a subsidy component or measure what that component may be.  We do presume, however, that competed contracts \u2013 contracts that are subject to an open bidding process &mdash; generally do not have a large subsidy component, even though the bidding process may include certain preferences.  Thus, we focus on those contracts that are not competed and make this information available to the public.  This does not mean non-competed contracts contain a significant subsidy, only that they are more likely to do so.</p>\n\n<h4>About FPDS</h4>\n\n<p>The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) tracks information about contractual purchases of goods and services made by the federal government.\u00a0 It is a vast and comprehensive system, but in some ways is less relevant to Subsidyscope's mission than the data in <a href=\"{% url about-faads %}\">Federal Award and Assistance Data Set</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Not every record in FPDS represents a subsidy.\u00a0 In many cases the records simply detail a government purchase of a good or service at the prevailing market price.\u00a0 Subsidyscope's advisory board agreed that it would be a mistake to classify such spending as subsidies to private industry.\u00a0 Instead, we focus on contracts that were not subjected to a fully open competitive bidding process.\u00a0 There are often good reasons for eschewing the competition process, which can be inefficient and time-consuming.\u00a0 But in some cases competition is avoided in order to provide a benefit to a specific bidder or class of bidders (e.g. an incumbent vendor; vendors owned members of historically disadvantaged groups).\u00a0 Although it is not possible to state whether a subsidy is present without a record-by-record analysis of each contract, most of the subsidies that have been intentionally inserted into the contracting process will be represented within the subset of contracts that were not fully competed.</p>\n\n<p>A further complication arises when assigning FPDS transactions to a sector.\u00a0 Although the expenditures made under a direct assistance program like those in FAADS typically have a narrow set of purposes and recipient types, an agency may procure a wide variety of products in the course of fulfilling its mandate, from office supplies to software to raw materials &mdash; a catering charge incurred by the Department of Transportation cannot be reasonably claimed to be a subsidy to the transportation sector. For this reason we have based our analysis on two pieces of data that are available to each FPDS record. When possible we use each record's <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/\">North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)</a> code, a standard for identifying industrial activity that is often included during the bidding process for a government contract.\u00a0 Unfortunately, not every record in FPDS contains a NAICS code. In these cases we use the <a href=\"http://www.fpdsng.com/downloads/service_product_codes.pdf\">Product/Service Code (PSC)</a> (PDF) to identify the appropriate sector for each record.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"http://www.eurunion.org/news/press/2004/200400137.htm\">http://www.eurunion.org/news/press/2004/200400137.htm</a></li>\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-2\" href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2007-03-23-eu-boeing-subsidy-ap_N.htm\">http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2007-03-23-eu-boeing-subsidy-ap_N.htm</a></li>\n</ol>", "locked": 0, "page": 26, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 59, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p>test</p>", "locked": 0, "page": 27, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 61, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p>Tax expenditures are government revenue losses resulting from provisions in the tax code that allow a taxpayer or business to reduce his or her tax burden by taking certain deductions, exemptions, or credits.  Tax expenditures have the same effect on the federal budget as government spending.  They can have effects on recipients similar to grants or other types of subsidies.  For instance, if the government wants to encourage people to buy solar panels for their homes, it can either send checks to those who promise to buy the panels or offer tax breaks once the panels have been purchased.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Tax expenditures can affect more than just the targeted activity.  When certain people or organizations are selected to receive targeted tax breaks through tax subsidies, the size of the tax base is reduced and tax rates then have to be increased for everyone in order to bring in an equivalent amount of revenue to the pre-tax expenditure level.  Further, if a tax subsidy is not expressly intended to make a tax more efficient, then it will most likely produce an economic inefficiency.  For example, when a tax subsidy is given to businesses to invest in a specific commodity, private investment is shifted from some other commodity into the tax-preferred area of investment without regard to the return on investment.  This creates an economic inefficiency. Tax subsidies can also end up rewarding taxpayers for behavior they would have engaged in regardless of the tax benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the federal income tax is a progressive tax and those with higher incomes pay a higher proportion in taxes, the value of a tax subsidy grows as income rises, reducing progressivity. This has led some to call tax expenditures \"upside down subsidies,\" since they tend to generally benefit those with higher incomes more than those with lower incomes in a progressive income tax system.</p>\r\n\r\n<img title=\"Total Tax Expenditures FY2008-20014\"  src=\"/media/images/transportation/tax_expenditure_total.png\"/>\r\n<cite>Source: Analytical Perspectives, President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2010 Budget.</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Not only do tax subsidies benefit a small group of interests \u2014 often those with higher incomes \u2014 they usually do not go through open, transparent political processes. Particularly true in the case of tax subsidies, expenditures through the revenue code are often large, hidden, and not subject to the same public debate as direct spending. Further, they do not get evaluated like much direct government spending does. Politicians often employ tax expenditures because they can use the tax code to confer benefits to constituents while campaigning on a platform of lowering taxes, which sounds quite a bit different than explaining that they use the tax code to benefit certain people and not others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are experts who disagree on what baseline should be used to measure tax expenditures.  Some assume that the current tax system is, or should be, a broad-based income tax.  Others argue it is, or should be, a consumption tax.  The baseline one uses can greatly change what gets counted.  For instance, using an income tax baseline, the exemption for investment income from Individual Retirement Accounts would be considered a tax expenditure.  Using the consumption tax baseline, this provision would not be counted as a tax expenditure since income from investments is not subject to a consumption tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope does not take a position on which tax structure is appropriate but presents tax expenditures estimates based on the income tax baseline because the Department of the Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) use this baseline in making their estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there are still differences between the estimates produced by the JCT and the Treasury even though the same income tax baseline is used. As the JCT explains in a recent document entitled \"<a href=\"http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=1196\">A Reconsideration of Tax Expenditure Analysis</a>,\" the Treasury's analysis has changed over time. It has shifted from the use of a \"normal\" to a \"reference\" baseline, as the tax starting point from which to measure income tax expenditures. A \"normal\" baseline is considered more theoretical in nature, and based on the economic notion of a comprehensive income tax that applies to all income, which we have never had in practice as some types of income are excluded from taxation. Alternatively, a \"reference\" baseline more closely matches the actual tax code that we have, and considers some of the deviations from a normal income tax as part of the baseline rather than counting them as tax expenditures.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Illustrating the dynamic nature of this debate, the JCT proposed in 2008 to move away from the use of a \"normal\" income tax baseline toward the use of a \"reference\" baseline. This would incorporate current codified tax law and would more closely resemble Treasury's model, rather than comparing current law to some theoretical and heretofore undefined in practical use, \"normal\" baseline. JCT asserts that this revised approach will result in a more principled and neutral approach to the issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on this information, Subsidyscope will present the Treasury's estimates, which are compiled annually by the Office of Management and Budget in the Analytical Perspectives of the President's Budget. Those interested in the JCT estimates may find them <a href=\"http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=1192\">here</a>; for the transportation sector, the estimates are very similar.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tax Expenditures for Transportation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax expenditures are not heavily used in the transportation sector in comparison to direct expenditures. As the table below illustrates, the totals in a given year are around $4 billion. Just as there are difficulties measuring subsidies in general, estimating tax subsidies is no different. Tax expenditure data presented are estimates of revenue forgone. They represent the lost revenue attributable to the use of the provision, which is not necessarily the same as what would be raised if the tax expenditure were repealed. Summing tax expenditures, while not technically accurate, often provides a reasonably good estimate for the total cost of groups of tax expenditures. The repeal of any single tax expenditure can trigger behavioral effects that in turn affect other tax expenditure amounts or even the total amount of tax revenue flowing into the Treasury. For example, if the tax expenditure favoring employee parking is repealed, more taxpayers may take the tax expenditure for employee transit passes, thus increasing the estimate for that tax expenditure.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\">\r\n<h4 style=\"margin-top:20px;\">Transportation Tax Expenditures for Individuals and Corporations by fiscal year ($ millions)</h4>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"header-row\">\r\n  <td></td>\r\n  \r\n  <td>2008</td>\r\n  <td>2009</td>\r\n  <td>2010</td>\r\n  <td>2011</td>\r\n  <td>2012</td>\r\n  <td>2013</td>\r\n  <td>2014</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\"><a href=\"/projects/transportation/tax-expenditures/employer-paid-benefits/\">Exclusion of employer-paid transportation benefits</a></td>\r\n\r\n  <td colspan=\"7\"></td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"subprogram\" >Exclusion of reimbursed employee parking expenses</td>\r\n  \r\n  <td>2,920</td>\r\n  <td>3,000</td>\r\n  <td>3,120</td>\r\n  <td>3,270</td>\r\n  <td>3,400</td>\r\n  <td>3,520</td>\r\n  <td>3,630</td>\r\n  \r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"subprogram\">Exclusion of reimbursed employee transit passes</td>\r\n  \r\n  <td>480</td>\r\n  <td>500</td>\r\n  <td>530</td>\r\n  <td>570</td>\r\n  <td>600</td>\r\n  <td>630</td>\r\n  <td>660</td>\r\n  \r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\"><a href=\"/projects/transportation/tax-expenditures/track-maintenance/\">Tax credit for certain expenditures for maintaining tracks</a></td>\r\n  \r\n  <td>180</td>\r\n  <td>180</td>\r\n  <td>70</td>\r\n  <td>20</td>\r\n  <td>10</td>\r\n  <td>10</td>\r\n  <td>0</td>\r\n  \r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\"><a href=\"/projects/transportation/tax-expenditures/bond-interest-exclusion/\">Exclusion of interest on bonds for financing of highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities</a></td>\r\n  \r\n  <td>80</td>\r\n  <td>90</td>\r\n  <td>100</td>\r\n  <td>100</td>\r\n  <td>90</td>\r\n  <td>60</td>\r\n  <td>60</td>\r\n  \r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n  <td class=\"program\"><a href=\"/projects/transportation/tax-expenditures/capital-construction-funds/\">Deferral of tax on shipping companies</a></td>\r\n  \r\n  <td>20</td>\r\n  <td>20</td>\r\n  <td>20</td>\r\n  <td>20</td>\r\n  <td>20</td>\r\n  <td>20</td>\r\n  <td>20</td>\r\n  \r\n<tr class=\"total\">\r\n <td class=\"program\">Total</td>\r\n \r\n <td>3,680</td>\r\n <td>3,790</td>\r\n <td>3,840</td>\r\n <td>3,980</td>\r\n <td>4,120</td>\r\n <td>4,240</td>\r\n <td>4,370</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<cite>Source: <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy10/pdf/spec.pdf\">Analytical Perspectives</a>, President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2010 Budget, p. 297.</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Click on specific tax expenditures above for time series estimates of revenue loss, as well as a description of each provision, including impact, rationale and assessment of each, done by the Congressional Research Service. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"footnotes\"><li>See pages 25-27 of <a href=\"http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=1196\">this document</a> for a summary of the methodological variation between the Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation and the estimates produced for the President's Budget by the Treasury Department.</li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Last updated September 28, 2009.</em></p>\r\n", "locked": 0, "page": 24, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 62, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p>The federal government uses direct expenditures to implement many programs.

When the government offers direct loans at below market interest rates, or terms more generous than what private markets would provide, there is a subsidy. Credit subsidies may also be provided when the government pays some of the interest or offers a grace period before the loan goes into repayment. Further subsidies may result from lower administrative fees than would normally be required by private lenders. For example, many student loans provide a subsidy to the borrower because they have lower interest rates than a standard loan. In some cases the government also pays for the interest on the loans while the borrower remains in school.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of a government loan guarantee, a private lender disburses the loan to the borrower, and the government acts as the guarantor of the loan by agreeing to make payments should the borrower fail to do so. Such a guarantee often allows a borrower to secure a loan at a lower interest rate than it could otherwise obtain.  Even if the interest rate is a market rate and the loan is repaid in full there may be a subsidy if the borrower did not pay an upfront fee for the guarantee, as they would from a private lender. In addition, a government guarantee encourages lenders to offer loans to borrowers to whom they might otherwise not \nextend credit. </p>\n\n<p>The way that the federal government accounts for the costs of federal credit, including the associated subsidies, has changed over time.  A significant shift occurred with the <a href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/02C17A.txt\">Federal Credit Reform \nAct of 1990</a>, which requires that the government use an accrual basis rather than a cash basis to budget for loans, with the main difference being the timing of the recognition of the government's loss on the transaction. This change means that an estimate of the net present value of the expected loss on the loan is accounted for in the budget when the loan is disbursed. While a big step toward increasing transparency, the 1990 change has some shortcomings. As the Congressional Budget Office explains in a 2004 report \"<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/57xx/doc5751/08-19-CreditSubsidies.pdf\">Estimating the Value of Subsidies for Federal Loans and Loan Guarantees</a>,\" the government underestimates the subsidy amount of loans and loan guarantees.  This lower estimate \nresults from two omissions: first the government does not include the cost of administering the loan (though this is accounted for elsewhere in the budget, it is not included in the subsidy cost of the credit); and second, the government &mdash; using methods required under credit reform &mdash; does not include the cost of market risk when calculating net present value. This risk is included in the cost of private market loans. These exclusions systematically understate the cost of loans and loan guarantees to the government. (For more on calculating subsidies under credit reform, see this <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/57xx/doc5751/08-19-CreditSubsidies.pdf\">report</a>.) </p>\n\n<p>Over the years the government's involvement in direct loans has remained fairly steady while it has become the guarantor of an increasing number of loans.  <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">According to the Office of Management and Budget in the President's Budget for fiscal year 2010</a>, the federal government had $286 billion outstanding in direct loans in 2008. In the same year, there were $1.4 trillion in government guaranteed loans on the budget. This makes the total outstanding federal credit $1.693 trillion. The largest category of both direct loans and loan guarantees is student loans, at $148 billion in direct loans and $415 billion in guaranteed student loans in 2008. Guarantees for home mortgage loans also make up a significant portion of government guaranteed loans. <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">OMB estimates</a> that the cost to the government of outstanding guaranteed loans through the Federal Housing Administration's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund in 2008 will be $448 billion.</p>\n\n<a name=\"insurance\"><h5>Insurance</h5></a>\n<p>The federal government operates a number of insurance programs.  These include insurance of bank deposits against financial loss through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; insurance of defined benefit pension plans through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; insurance against natural disasters,such as crop insurance and flood insurance; and insurance against security-related risks, such as war time insurance.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>Government insurance programs often provide a subsidy to beneficiaries. When lower than actuarially fair premiums are charged, a subsidy is provided to the insured. A key characteristic of government insurance programs is their lack of visibility in the federal budget. Insurance programs expose the government to trillions of dollars of contingent liability, yet these potential claims on taxpayers are not reported in the federal budget unless losses occur.<sup>2</sup> For this reason it is difficult to obtain data on government insurance programs and the subsidies they provide.</p>\n\n<p>Insurance programs are reported in the budget on a cash basis. They look like moneymakers for the government in most years because the premiums paid in good times outweigh the claims paid, even if future claims after a bad event swamp the premiums paid.  Insurance programs also appear to be self-financing and less dependent on taxes, even though future claims may burden taxpayers. Further, they often target a relatively small group (such as farmers). For these reasons, indirect subsidies through insurance programs are politically appealing because politicians can take credit for visibly supporting specific constituents while also claiming that they are not spending taxpayer dollars.</p>\n\n<p>The following sections look more closely at three categories of federal insurance: insurance against financial risk, insurance against natural disasters, and insurance against national security related risks. </p>\n\n<a name=\"financialrisk\"><h5>Insurance  Against Financial Risk</h5></a>\n  \n<p>Before the financial bailout of 2008, two insurance programs in the financial sector &mdash; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) &mdash; were responsible for most of the trillions of dollars of government insurance exposure. Through the FDIC, the federal government insures depositors against the failure of banks up to $250,000<sup>2</sup> per depositor. When an institution fails, a charge is made against the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is supported by fees imposed on the banking industry. The fund is also supported by a backstop line of credit from the U.S. Treasury that could be tapped if the fees were insufficient to cover losses. <a href=\"http://www.subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/fdic/bank-failures/\">A rash of bank failures</a> caused the fund's balance to drop from about $52 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 to about $13 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2009.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government also insures against the insolvency of firms with underfunded pension plans to pay out promised pension benefits (defined-benefits plans) through the PBGC. The largest 10 claims against the PBGC's single employer program from 1975 to 2007 <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">totaled $32.6 billion</a>. Nine of these 10 claims came after 2001; leaving the program at a $10.7 billion deficit in 2008 as compared to a $9.7 billion surplus at the end of 2000. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to increasing the amount insured under federal deposit insurance, the government's response to the financial crisis included actions such as extending credit, guaranteeing more debt and assets and purchasing a number of mortgage-backed securities \nheld by government sponsored enterprises.  See these Subsidyscope posts for more on the recent activities of the <a href=\"/projects/bailout/federal-reserve/\">Federal Reserve</a>, <a href=\"/projects/bailout/treasury/\">the Treasury</a>, <a href=\"/projects/bailout/fdic/bank-failures/\">the FDIC</a> and <a href=\"/projects/bailout/fhlb/\">Federal Home Loan Banks</a>.</p>\n\n<a name=\"naturaldisaster\"><h5>Insurance Against Natural Disasters </h5></a>\n\n<p>In order to insure against natural disasters, the government provides two main insurance programs &mdash; crop insurance and flood insurance. Crop insurance, administered by the US Department of Agriculture in conjunction with the private insurance industry, protects farmers against low yields and crop quality that may result from bad weather or insect damage. Flood insurance, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency within the Department of Homeland Security, provides insurance \"<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">to homeowners and businesses in communities that have adopted and enforced appropriate flood plain measures</a>.\" At the end of 2008, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">OMB reports</a> that 5.6 million policies collectively worth more than $1 trillion were in force in more than 20,200 communities. While disaster insurance programs can be large, on the whole they are smaller than insurance against financial insolvency. </p>\n\n<a name=\"securityrelated\"><h5>Insurance Against Security-Related Risks </h5></a>\n\n<p>The federal government offers several types of insurance against acts of war and terrorism, including terrorism risk insurance, aviation war risk insurance, and maritime war risk insurance. Terrorism risk insurance &mdash; enacted in 2002 in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks &mdash; was set up as a temporary program to support the insurance industry. The budget includes estimates of the cost of the terrorism risk insurance; however, this does not represent the potential costs were there to be  future attacks. The extension of the legislation &mdash; <a href=\"http://treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/financial-institution/terrorism-insurance/\">the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act</a> &mdash; in 2007 is slated to sunset in 2014. Reflecting this extension, the insurance <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">is forecasted</a> to cost taxpayers $2.16 billion from 2009 &mdash; 2014, and $3.069 billion from 2009 &ndash; 2018 (spending less receipts from premium surcharges). The <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\"><i>Analytical Perspectives</i></a> of the President's Budget for fiscal year 2010 states that the \"Administration proposes to lessen Federal intervention in this insurance market and reduce the subsidy to private insurers\" (i.e., increase the private sector's share of losses). </p>\n\n<p>Many airlines hold insurance policies against catastrophic events such as war or terrorism. After the September 11, 2001, attacks, third party liability war risk coverage that airlines carried through private insurers was canceled, and the cost of other war risk insurance coverage dramatically increased. As one of the many government responses, the Secretary of Homeland Security was required \"<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">to provide additional war risk insurance coverage for hull losses and passenger liability to air carriers insured for third-party war risk liability as of June 29, 2002</a>.\" The Federal Aviation Administration has made such insurance coverage available; further, the Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to limit an air carrier's third party liability to $100 million when loss stems from terrorism. Many airlines could be grounded without such coverage. </p>\n\n<p>Backing these policies is the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund of the Department of Transportation. This fund currently insures 62 air carries for between $80 million to $4 billion per carrier (median insurance is $1.8 billion). The fund contains $1.15 billion in premiums paid in as of the end of 2008, which <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">the Office of Management and Budget states</a> would be insufficient to \"meet either the coverage limits of the largest policies in force ($4 billion) or to meet a series of large claims in succession.\" The federal government would be on the hook \nfor any outstanding claims in the fund.</p>\n\n<p>The government also offers a <a href=\"{% url transportation-cfda-programpage-by-programnumber 20.803 %}\">maritime war risk insurance</a> program that makes insurance available to commercial ships during wartime. <a href=\"http://www.marad.dot.gov/about_us_landing_page/budget_information/Budget_In_Brief.htm\">According to the Department of Transportation</a>, the program, along with other Maritime Administration initiatives, \"assures [Department of Defense] access to U.S.-flag commercial ships and crews during DOD mobilizations, and helps ensure the efficient flow of military cargo through commercial ports.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Last updated September 28, 2009.</em></p>\n\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\n<li>Social Security is often called \"Social\" Insurance, but its key features sufficiently distinguish it from the other insurance programs considered here.</li>\n<li>The current level of $250,000 is a temporary increase through December 2009; it was raised from $100,000 in October 2008.

The fund is supported by excise taxes on passenger tickets, freight and fuel. It provides all of the money for the FAA's airport improvement, facilities and equipment, and research and development activities &mdash; <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/aba/budgets_brief/media/2010_budget_highlights\">a total of about $6.4 billion for fiscal year 2009</a>, not including $1.3 billion in supplemental appropriations under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  Programs financed by the trust fund include construction grants to airports, subsidies to airlines serving small communities and modernization of the air traffic control system. The fund also supports between one-half and two-thirds of the FAA's operations budget, <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/aba/budgets_brief/media/2010_budget_highlights\">which is about $9 billion for fiscal year 2009</a>. The rest of the agency's funding comes from general revenue.</p>\n\n<p>The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and the Essential Air Service (EAS) program are among the major aviation programs included in Subsidyscope. The AIP redirects tax revenues from the places where they are generated to other locations; the EAS involves direct payments to airlines that operate in little-served communities.</p>\n\n<p>The AIP draws all of its revenue from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. It handed out $3.5 billion to airports in fiscal 2008 for construction, rehabilitation, noise studies and other initiatives. The EAS program is supported partly by the trust fund and partly by overflight fees imposed on carriers that use U.S. airspace but neither take off from, nor land, in this country. It provided $108 million in subsidy payments to airlines serving small communities in calendar year 2008, and is expected to dispense as much as $150 million this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Last updated September 28, 2009.</em></p>", "locked": 0, "page": 34, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 70, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "Filler", "locked": 0, "page": 33, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 73, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<img src=\"/media/images/transportation/highway_photo.jpg\" class=\"floatl tooling\" alt=\"image of an on-ramp\" />\n\n<p>Highway spending in the United States is administered primarily through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), a division of the Department of Transportation (DOT).  The FHWA administers two main programs.  The Federal-Aid Highway Program maintains both the National Highway System and about one million additional miles of other roads.  The Federal Lands Highway Program maintains roads on federal lands, such as national parks and forests.  The FHWA also conducts safety research and funds projects to alleviate congestion on highways. Two smaller agencies within the DOT conduct their own highway safety programs: the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is charged with enforcing safety and fuel-economy standards for motor vehicles, and the National Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates commercial vehicles, such as trucks.</p>\n\n<p>Funding for the FHWA comes from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. The fund is financed through excise taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, truck tires and other items.  These taxes include the 18.4-cent-per-gallon federal tax on gasoline, as well as taxes on diesel fuel, truck tires and other items.  <a href=\"http://www.usaspending.gov/faads/faads.php?cfda_program_num=20.205&sortby=u&detail=1&datype=T&repty\">The FHWA directs</a> almost all of the money to government recipients, primarily state departments of transportation, which must match a portion of the funds. The actual construction and upkeep of the roads is performed by state and local governments. </p>\n\n<p>In fiscal year 2009, the <a href=\"http://www.dot.gov/budget/2010/bib2010.pdf\">FHWA's budget was $69.1 billion</a>. This figure is much higher than in previous years, because it includes $27.5 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  A small fraction of the FHWA's budget comes from the general fund for miscellaneous projects, such as the Appalachian Development Highway Program. </p>\n\n<p>Not all Highway Trust Fund money is spent on highways. <a href=\"https://cfda.symplicity.com/index?s=program&mode=form&tab=step1&id=c8d10946760c71bcee01ebf0f1e4525\">Roughly 80 percent of the money goes to highway projects</a>; most of the rest goes to mass transit projects. The portion that goes to highways is intended primarily for the construction and upkeep of roads to facilitate interstate commerce and travel. Funds may also be allocated for projects such as bridge repair, safety improvements, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, carpools and recreational trails. </p>\n\n<p>Federal subsidies to highways are difficult to quantify because the money is distributed to state governments, which administer the programs and are not required to publicly disclose details of their spending. Some subsidies arise as departments of transportation look for new ways to finance highway projects. States, for example, have begun to lease public roads to private companies.  Those companies spend large sums for long-term leases of public roads &mdash; $3.8 billion was spent for a 75-year lease of a toll road in Indiana &mdash; and can then raise revenue by charging tolls.  These companies are commonly granted tax benefits such as partial tax-free financing and accelerated depreciation. </p>\n\n\n<p><em>Last updated September 28, 2009.</em></p>", "locked": 0, "page": 35, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 75, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<img src=\"/media/images/transportation/maritime_photo.jpg\" class=\"floatl tooling\" alt=\"image of a container ship at sea\" />\n\n<p>The federal government supports the U.S. maritime industry through the Maritime Administration (MARAD), which is part of the Department of Transportation (DOT). MARAD\u2019s mission is to advance marine transportation &mdash; primarily ships and barges &mdash; and put forth a \"<a href=\"http://www.marad.dot.gov/about_us_landing_page/budget_information/Budget_In_Brief.htm\">viable U.S. merchant marine that is vital to commerce, emergency response, and national security.</a>\" Among other things, MARAD maintains the Maritime Security Fleet and the Ready Reserve Force. Both programs make ships available to the military during national security emergencies.</p>\n\n<p>MARAD's entire budget comes from the general fund. The Maritime Security Program accounts for more than half of the budget, sending direct payments to owners of the 60 ships and barges that participate in the program. For fiscal year 2009, $174 million of the $333 million budget went to the Maritime Security Fleet, with each participating ship receiving a flat payment of $2.9 million. The second largest chunk of the budget, <a href=\"http://www.marad.dot.gov/about_us_landing_page/budget_information/Budget_In_Brief.htm\">$61 million</a>, went toward operations of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA). In 2009, <a href=\"http://www.marad.dot.gov/ships_shipping_landing_page/small_shipyard_grants/small_shipyard_grants.htm\">MARAD received $100 million in supplemental funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a> to be used for small shipyard assistance. </p>\n\n<p>MARAD provides a large proportion of its budget as subsidies to the maritime industry. All told, $256 million &mdash; or 77 percent &mdash; of its fiscal year 2009 budget was dedicated to the growth of the industry. Aside from the Maritime Security Program and the USMMA, subsidies are given to state maritime academies and participants in the Maritime Guaranteed Lo<!---->an program, aiding in the construction and rehabilitation of ships.  Subsidies are also available through small shipyard assistance grants and two tax-deferral programs.</p>\n\n<p>The maritime industry also receives implied subsidies from laws established to limit foreign competition and incentivize producers of American goods to use U.S.-flag ships. One example of this is the Jones Act, which mandates that all shipping from one American port to another be done by a U.S.-flag ship. Another example is the Military Cargo Preference Act, which requires that at least 50 percent of civilian agency goods shipped internationally be carried by U.S.-flag vessels. The Cargo Preference Act requires that all military cargo be carried on a U.S.-flag ship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Last updated September 28, 2009.</em></p>", "locked": 0, "page": 38, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 77, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<img src=\"/media/images/transportation/rail_photo.jpg\" class=\"floatl tooling\" alt=\"image of a train\" />\n\n<p>The rail industry in the United States has two distinct components: freight and passenger.

The fund is supported by fuel taxes and other excise taxes on motorists. The Mass Transit Account currently receives about 19 percent of the total fund or about <a href=\"http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/factsheets/guarfunding.htm\">$10.3 billion</a>. Only one FTA program &mdash; for public transportation research &mdash; is supported by the general fund.</p>\n\n<p>In 2009, an additional <a href=\"http://www.dot.gov/budget/2010/bib2010.pdf\">$7.65 billion</a> was allocated to the FTA under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, bringing total transit funding for 2009 to approximately $18 billion. Most of the recovery money will fund capital assistance grants.</p>\n\n<p>The FTA also provides direct loans, loan guarantees, lines of credit, and credit enhancement support such as bond insurance for transit through the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) and the State Infrastructure Bank program. TIFIA is aimed at attracting private and non-federal investment in transportation projects by offering loans and loan guarantees. The program is designed to complement federal grants with financing for infrastructure. Since 1998, more than <a href=\"http://tifia.fhwa.dot.gov/projects/approved.cfm\">$500 million</a> in direct loans were issued to two transit programs and one intermodal project with a strong transit component under the TIFIA program. A $600 million loan guarantee was issued to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Capital Improvement Program in 1999 \u2013 making it the single largest recipient of a TIFIA loan guarantee thus far. </p>\n<p class=\"inline-image floatl\"><img src=\"/media/images/transportation/transit_spending.png\" /><br /><cite style=\"font-size:.8em;display:block; width:530px;\">Source: National Transit Database (1991-2007). <br />* A transit mode in Puerto Rico of privately-owned passenger vans or small buses that are unsubsidized but regulated by local governments</cite></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000142----000-.html\">Exempt Facility Bonds</a> also give private investors, who fund transportation and other public infrastructure projects, a tax break on interest they might earn on such bonds.

These low interest rates allow issuers to construct highway or surface freight transfer facilities at lower cost. Some of the benefits of the tax exemption and federal subsidy also flow to bondholders. For a discussion of the factors that determine the shares of benefits going to bondholders and users of the highway or surface freight transfer facilities, and estimates of the distribution of tax-exempt interest income by income class, see the \"Impact\" discussion under General Purpose Public Assistance: Exclusion of Interest on Public Purpose State and Local Debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline-image floatr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\r\n<img title=\"Total Tax Expenditures FY2008-20014\" src=\"/media/images/transportation/tax_expenditure_state_local_bonds.png\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<cite style=\"width:575px; display:block;\">Source: Analytical Perspectives, President\u2019s Fiscal Year Budget, 2007-2010. <br/>Numbers provided are from the most recent estimate.</cite>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Rationale</h4>\r\n<p>Before 1968, State and local governments were allowed to act as conduits for the issuance of tax-exempt bonds to finance privately owned and operated facilities. The Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968 (RECA 1968), however, imposed tests that restricted the issuance of these bonds. The Act provided a specific exception which allowed issuance for specific projects such as non-government-owned docks and wharves. Intermodal facilities are similar in function to docks and wharves, yet were not included in the original list of qualified facilities. The addition of truck to-rail and rail-to-truck intermodal projects to the list of qualified private activities in 2005 is intended enhance the efficiency of the nation\u2019s long distance freight transport infrastructure. With more efficient intermodal facilities, proponents suggest that long distance truck traffic will shift from government financed interstate highways to privately owned long distance rail transport.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\n<p>State and local governments tend to view these facilities as potential economic development tools. The desirability of allowing these bonds to be eligible for tax-exempt status hinges on one's view of whether the users of such facilities should pay the full cost, or whether sufficient social benefits exist to justify federal taxpayer subsidy. Economic theory suggests that to the extent these facilities provide social benefits that extend beyond the boundaries of the State or local government, the facilities might be\r\nunderprovided due to the reluctance of State and local taxpayers to finance benefits for nonresidents.\r\nEven if a case can be made for a federal subsidy arising from underinvesting at the State and local level, it is important to recognize the potential costs. As one of many categories of tax-exempt private-activity bonds, those issued for transfer facilities increase the financing cost of bonds issued for other public capital. With a greater supply of public bonds, the interest rate on the bonds necessarily increases to lure investors. In addition, expanding the availability of tax-exempt bonds increases the assets available\r\nto individuals and corporations to shelter their income from taxation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><cite>Source: <a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_senate_committee_prints&docid=f:45728.pdf\">Compendium of Background Materials on Individual Provisions</a>, Congressional Research Service.

Such deposits are deductible from taxable income, and income tax on the earnings of the deposits in the CCF is deferred. When tax-deferred deposits and their earnings are withdrawn from a CCF, no tax is paid if the withdrawal is used for qualifying purposes, such as to construct, acquire, lease, or pay off the indebtedness on a qualifying vessel. A qualifying vessel must be constructed or reconstructed in the United States, and any lease period must be at least five years. The tax basis of the vessel (usually its cost to the owner), with respect to which the operator's depreciation deductions are computed, is reduced by the amount of such withdrawal. Thus, over the life of the vessel tax depreciation will be reduced, and taxable income will be increased by the amount of such withdrawal, thereby reversing the effect of the deposit. However, since gain on the sale of the vessel and income from the operation of the replacement vessel may be deposited into the CCF, the tax deferral may be extended. Withdrawals for other purposes are taxed at the top tax rate. This rule prevents firms from withdrawing funds in loss years and escaping tax entirely.

Even when funds are eventually withdrawn and taxed, there is a substantial deferral of tax that leads to a very low effective tax burden. The provision makes investment in U.S.-constructed ships and registry under the U.S. flag more attractive than it would otherwise be. Despite these benefits, however, there is very little (in some years, no) U.S. participation in the worldwide market\r\nsupplying large commercial vessels. The incentive for construction is perhaps less than it would otherwise be, because firms engaged in international shipping have the benefits of deferral of tax through other provisions of the tax law, regardless of where the ship is constructed. This provision is likely to benefit higher-income individuals who are the primary owners of capital (see Introduction for a discussion).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rationale</h4>\r\n<p>The special tax treatment originated to ensure an adequate supply of shipping in the event of war. Although tax subsidies of various types have been in existence since 1936, the coverage of the subsidies was expanded substantially by the Merchant Marine Act of 1970. Before the Tax Reform Act of 1976 it was unclear whether any investment tax credit was available for eligible vessels financed in whole or\r\nin part out of funds withdrawn from a CCF. The 1976 Act specifically provided (as part of the Internal Revenue Code) that a minimum investment credit equal to 50 percent of an amount withdrawn which was to purchase, construct, or reconstruct qualified vessels was available in 1976 and subsequent years.\r\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986 incorporated the deferral provisions directly into the Internal Revenue Code. It also extended benefits to leasing, provided for the minimum 25-year period in the fund, and required payment of the tax at the top rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\n<p>The failure to tax income from the services of shipping normally misallocates resources into less efficient uses, although it appears that the effects on U.S. large commercial shipbuilding are relatively small.\r\nThere are two possible arguments that could be advanced for maintaining this tax benefit. The first is the national defense argument \u2014 that it is important to maintain a shipping and shipbuilding capability in time of war. This justification may be in doubt today, since U.S. firms control many vessels registered under a foreign flag and many U.S. allies control a substantial shipping fleet and have substantial ship-building capability that might be available to the U.S. There is also an argument that subsidizing domestic ship-building and flagging offsets some other subsidies \u2014 both shipbuilding subsidies that are granted by other countries, and the deferral provisions of the U.S. tax code that encourage foreign flagging of U.S.-owned vessels. Economic theory suggests, however, that efficiency is not necessarily enhanced by introducing further distortions to counteract existing ones.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><cite>Source: <a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_senate_committee_prints&docid=f:45728.pdf\">Compendium of Background Materials on Individual Provisions</a>, Congressional Research Service.

The subsidy benefits both\r\nemployees, through higher compensation, and their employers, who may\r\nface lower wage costs. To the extent that this exemption induces employees\r\nto use mass transportation and to the extent that mass transportation reduces\r\ntraffic congestion, this exemption lowers commuting costs to all workers in\r\nurban areas.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHigher income individuals are more likely to benefit from the parking\r\nexclusion than the mass transit and van pool subsidies to the extent that the\r\npropensity to drive to work is correlated with income. The effective value\r\nof the transit benefits rise with marginal tax rate of a recipients. The value\r\nof the benefit also depends on the location of the employer: the provision is\r\ntargeted towards the taxpayers working in the highly urbanized areas or other\r\nplaces where transit is available or parking space is limited. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Rationale</h4>\r\n<p>A statutory exclusion for the value of parking was introduced in 1984,\r\nalong with exclusions for several other fringe benefits. Some employers had\r\nprovided one or more of these fringe benefits for many years, and employers,\r\nemployees, and the Internal Revenue Service had not considered those\r\nbenefits to be taxable income. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Comprehensive Energy Policy Act of 1992 placed a dollar ceiling on\r\nthe exclusion of parking facilities and introduced the exclusions for mass\r\ntransit facilities and van pools in order to encourage mass commuting, which\r\nwould in turn reduce traffic congestion and pollution. In 1998, the\r\nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century raised the benefit limits and\r\nmodified their phase-in periods and inflation adjustment rules. Employees\r\nat that time could also choose to receive cash instead of transit benefits.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Many employers used fringe benefits during World War II to attract\r\nworkers because wage and price controls limited their ability to compete for\r\nlabor. A generation later, Congress sought to limit the use of tax-free fringe\r\nbenefits such as employer-provided transportation benefits. After the\r\nTreasury Department proposed and then withdrew regulations regarding the\r\ntax treatment of certain fringe benefits, Congress in 1978 imposed a\r\nmoratorium, which was extended in 1981, on such regulations. In the Deficit\r\nReduction Act of 1984, Congress introduced new rules governing the tax\r\ntreatment of fringe benefits. At that time, Congress expressed concern that\r\nwithout clear boundaries on the use of these fringe benefits, new approaches\r\ncould emerge that would further erode the tax base and increase inequities\r\namong employees in different businesses and industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\n<p>The exclusion subsidizes employment in those businesses and industries\r\nlocated where transportation fringe benefits are feasible and commonly used.\r\nBusinesses and industries located where mass transportation alternatives are\r\nlacking gain little or no benefit from this provision.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSubsidies for mass transit and van pools encourage use of mass\r\ntransportation and may reduce congestion and pollution. Motivating\r\ncommuters in highly urbanized areas to use mass transportation can reduce\r\ncommuting costs generally. If workers commute in ways that reduce traffic\r\ncongestion, all commuters in an area may enjoy spillover benefits such as\r\nlower transportation costs, shorter waiting times in traffic, and improved air\r\nquality.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDetermining fair market values for fringe benefits such as free or reduced\r\nprice parking may be difficult in some places. Most highly urbanized areas,\r\nhowever, have many commercial parking lots, so that calculating comparable\r\nvalue of a parking benefits in those areas may be straightforward.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFringe benefits are part of the total compensation package that employees\r\nreceive and that employers provide to compete in labor markets. If some\r\nfringe benefits, such as transportation benefits, are not considered taxable\r\nincome, then both employers and firms may wish to reduce taxable wages\r\nand salaries in order to increase untaxed fringe benefits.

Railroad track maintenance expenditures are amounts, which may be either repairs or capitalized costs, spent to maintain railroad track (including roadbed, bridges, and related track structures) owned or leased as of January 1, 2005, by a Class II or Class III railroad. Eligible taxpayers are smaller (Class II or Class III) railroads and any person who transports property using these rail facilities or furnishes property or services to such a person. The taxpayer\u2019s basis in railroad track is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed (so that any deduction of cost or depreciation is only on the cost net of the credit). The credit cannot be carried back to years before 2005. The credit covers expenditures from 2005-2007. For 2005-2008 the amount eligible is the gross expenditures not taking into account reductions such as discounts or loan forgiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\">\r\n<h5 style=\"margin-top:20px;\">Tax Expenditure by fiscal year ($ millions)</h5>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"header-row\"><td></td>\r\n<td>2004</td>\r\n<td>2005</td>\r\n<td>2006</td>\r\n<td>2007</td>\r\n<td>2008</td>\r\n<td>2009</td>\r\n<td>2010</td>\r\n<td>2011</td>\r\n<td>2012</td>\r\n<td>2013</td>\r\n<td>2014</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program\">Corporations</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n<td>70</td>\r\n<td>140</td>\r\n<td>120</td>\r\n<td>160</td>\r\n<td>160</td>\r\n<td>60</td>\r\n<td>20</td>\r\n<td>10</td>\r\n<td>10</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n<td class=\"program\">Individuals</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n<td>10</td>\r\n<td>20</td>\r\n<td>20</td>\r\n<td>10</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"total\">\r\n <td class=\"program\">Total</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n<td>70</td>\r\n<td>140</td>\r\n<td>130</td>\r\n<td>180</td>\r\n<td>180</td>\r\n<td>70</td>\r\n<td>20</td>\r\n<td>10</td>\r\n<td>10</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<cite>Source: Analytical Perspectives, President\u2019s Fiscal Year Budget, 2006-2010.

According to the Federal Railroad Administration, as of the last survey in 1993, these\r\nrailroads accounted for 25% of the nation\u2019s rail miles. These regional railroads are particularly important in providing transportation of agricultural products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline-image floatr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\r\n<img title=\"Total Tax Expenditures FY2008-20014\" src=\"/media/images/transportation/tax_expenditure_track_maintenance.png\"/> <br/>\r\n<cite style=\"width:550px;display:block;\">Source: Analytical Perspectives, President\u2019s Fiscal Year Budget, 2006-2010. <br/> Numbers provided are from the most recent estimate.</cite>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rationale</h4>\r\n<p>This provision was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-357). While no official rationale was provided in the bill, sponsors of earlier free-standing legislation and industry advocates indicated that the purpose was to encourage the rehabilitation, rather than the abandonment, of short line railroads, which were spun off in the deregulation of railroads in the early 1980s. Advocates also indicated that this service is threatened by heavier 286,000-pound cars that must travel on\r\nthese lines because of inter-connectivity. They also suggested that preserving these local lines will reduce local truck traffic. These is also some indication that a tax credit was thought to be more likely to be achieved than grants. The temporary provision relating to discounts was added by H.R. 6111 (December 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\n<p>The arguments stated by the industry advocates and sponsors of the legislation are also echoed in assessments by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), which indicated the need for rehabilitation and improvement, especially to deal with heavier cars. The FRA also suggested that these firms have particular difficulty with access to bank loans. In general, special subsidies to industries and activities tend to lead to inefficient investment allocation since in a competitive economy businesses should earn enough to maintain their capital. Nevertheless it may be judged or considered desirable to subsidize rail transportation in order to reduce the congestion and pollution of highway traffic. At the same time, a tax credit may be less suited to remedy the problem than a direct grant since firms without sufficient tax liability cannot use the credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n<h4>Selected Bibliography</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"bibliography\">\r\n<li>Prater, Marvin, The Long Term Viability of Short Line and Regional Railroads.

But the real story is what the data doesn't show.  Last month  saw a flurry of stories about the poor quality of Recovery Act data, many of them prompted by the infamous <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/07/20/recoverygov-description-fail/\">million-dollar ham</a> &mdash; a transaction record on <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov\">Recovery.gov</a> that made it look like the government had paid upward of a million dollars for two pounds of ham.  In fact, the money was spent on a large quantity of ham in two-pound packages.  The confusion caused by this ambiguous record led many to wonder about the quality of Recovery.gov's reporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Subsidyscope team continues its investigation into federal subsidies, we are becoming familiar with the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/govs/www/faadsmain.html\">Federal Assistance Award Data System</a> (FAADS) and the <a href=\"https://www.fpds.gov/\">Federal Procurement Data System</a> (FPDS), the primary sources for Recovery.gov's data.  Based on what we've  learned, the million-dollar ham is only one cut of a very large data problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In truth, records like the one regarding the ham purchase are among the better ones available. Such records may be ambiguous or confusing, but they can be corrected with some additional investigation.  We've found many cases where the data simply doesn't exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We've been comparing spending estimates from the government's <a href=\"https://www.cfda.gov/\">Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</a> (CFDA) with spending totals calculated from FAADS.  These figures should, at least approximately, match.  In many cases they do; in others it's clear that something is amiss.  For instance, for fiscal year 2008 half of Amtrak's spending, or $660 million, is omitted.  Some programs are entirely absent: according to FAADS, the Merchant Marine Academy (total FY08 budget: $62.7 million) doesn't exist.  Our analysis uses the CFDA as a quality check on FAADS, but even the CFDA can be bafflingly inconsistent.  For instance, a war risk insurance program for ships is included in the CFDA.  A nearly-identical one for airplanes is not.  It's difficult to know exactly how much data is missing, but <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06294.pdf\">the most recent analysis of FAADS by the Government Accountability Office</a> found that 25 percent of the examined programs were under- or over-reporting their spending; another 22 percent weren't reporting anything at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.usaspending.gov\">USASpending.gov</a> serves as the interface between the public and FAADS, but it does little to acknowledge the problem of stray spending data.  A link to a discussion of \"Data Quality\" is displayed prominently on every page of the site, but the actual mechanism by which USASpending.gov tracks data quality seems woefully inadequate.  The site appears to simply measure the completeness of each record that is reported to it.  Identifying missing parts of a record is useful, but it does nothing to identify when whole records are missing.  The system makes sure we've got a price on the ham, but can't figure out that the Maritime Administration, including the Merchant Marine Academy, has been mislaid.  Currently there is no means by which USASpending.gov can ensure that it is receiving all of the records it should be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These data quality problems are not new.  Systems like FAADS and FPDS have suffered from inconsistent and inaccurate data since they were created.  In 2006 Congress recognized that the existing systems had failed and passed <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/about_omb/109-282.pdf\">legislation</a> to create USASpending.gov. Unfortunately, the new system did little more than repackage existing data. The past three years have seen few improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the new system, reporting remains incomplete and erroneous, and the resulting data remains unreliable. Both the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/memoranda_fy2009/m09-19.pdf\">current</a> and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2008/m08-04.pdf\">former</a> administrations have asked agencies to address the quality and timeliness of reporting, but as of yet, no true mandate for improvement has been issued and no measurements of success from these efforts have been reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Subsidyscope we'll ensure that our analysis acknowledges the shortcomings of FAADS and FPDS by showing users where those datasets diverge from other spending data.  Sadly, FAADS and FPDS remain the best available sources for transactional data about federal spending.  But their limitations are real, and it's past time that they were improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taxpayers have a right to know where their money is going.  Good information on the costs of federal programs will be necessary if the nation is going to make informed decisions between and among federal programs.  The problem of insufficiently descriptive spending data pales in comparison to the problem of data that is missing &mdash; and worse, not known to be missing.  Until this is fixed, a million-dollar ham will be the least of our worries.</p>", "locked": 0, "page": 43, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 85, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p>In the coming months, <a href=\"{% url index %}\">Subsidyscope.com</a> will be spending less time tracking bailout-related subsidies and more time examining government assistance in the transportation sector.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"csmonitor-image-container\">\r\n<a href=\"http://patchworknation.csmonitor.com/csmstaff/2009/0511/where-tarp-money-is-going-a-cultural-divide/\"><img src=\"/media/images/csmonitor_small.png\" class=\"story-image\" /></a>\r\n<div id=\"csmonitor-caption\">Graphics produced by the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> using data from Subsidyscope to further show how TARP spending broke down by percentages and community types.

In fiscal year 2008, Ex-Im authorized $356 million in direct loans, $10.2 billion in loan guarantees and $3.9 billion of insurance. <a href=\"http://www.exim.gov/about/reports/ar/ar2008/documents/SmallBuisnessReport.pdf\">Ex-Im reports</a> that by dollar value, about 22 percent of its loans, guarantees and credit insurance went toward assisting small businesses in fiscal year 2008 and <a href=\"http://www.exim.gov/about/reports/ar/ar2007/images/Small%20Business.pdf\">27 percent</a> in fiscal year 2007. By number of  transactions, about 86 percent of its financing was directed toward support for small business exporters for the two fiscal years combined.  </p>\n\n  <p>However, Ex-Im's largest financial commitments are in long-term loan guarantees, the category in which Boeing benefits most. In fiscal years 2007 and 2008 combined, Ex-Im issued $15.3 billion in long-term <a href=\"/glossary/#loan-guarantee\">loan guarantees</a>. Of that total, almost $10 billion, or 65 percent, went toward the purchase of commercial aircraft made by Boeing. In <a href=\"http://www.exim.gov/about/reports/ar/ar2008/documents/Financial%20Report/AuthorizationsListings.pdf\">fiscal year 2008  alone</a>, Ex-Im issued long-term guarantees on $8.1 billion in loans made by banks in 23 countries. Nearly $5.5 billion&mdash;67 percent&mdash;of that total supported the sale of Boeing airplanes in nations such as Brazil, Canada, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates. Those four countries accounted for the largest dollar values of Ex-Im supported Boeing sales.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin: 0pt 0px 15px; width: 99%; float: left;\">\n<img src=\"/media/images/transportation/eximsupplier.png\" style=\"float: left; margin-top: 2px; margin-right: 35px;\" />\n<img src=\"/media/images/transportation/eximproduct.png\" style=\"float: left;\" />\n<cite style=\"clear:both;width:180px; display:block; margin: 0px auto;\"><strong>Total Guarantees: $15.3 billion</strong></cite>\n\n<div class=\"download-link\"><a href=\"/media/data/exim_07-09.csv\">Download source data (CSV)</a></div>\n</div>\n\n  <p>In fiscal year 2007, loans for Boeing aircraft accounted for $4.5 billion, or 62 percent, of $7.2  billion in long-term guarantees. For the first 8 \u00bd months of fiscal  year 2009, the bank issued just under $3.5 billion in long-term guarantees. Slightly more than a third of this amount&mdash;$1.3 billion&mdash;went to support  the purchase of Boeing airplanes.</p>\n\n  <p>Other beneficiaries of Ex-Im's  long-term guarantees in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 include the Bechtel  Corporation, a large engineering firm, which accounted for about 6 percent  of the value of such guarantees during the period, followed by Applied  Materials Inc., a capital equipment producer for the semiconductor and  solar industries, which accounted for 4 percent. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLP and other U.S. suppliers working on a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia also accounted for 4 percent. Products and services from companies such  as AGI Industries, General Electric and Deere & Co. made up the remaining 21 percent.</p>\n\n  <p>Examining the products and  services that were subsidized, Ex-Im data for the two fiscal years  show that exports of aircraft (made by Boeing and other suppliers) accounted  for 66 percent of the value of the guarantees; oil, gas and petrochemical  equipment accounted for 21 percent, and silicon wafer fabrication machinery  for a plant in Singapore, 4 percent. Items such as power plant equipment and services, fire trucks and construction equipment and services made up the remaining 9 percent.</p>\n\n  <p>Boeing maintains that the support  it receives through U.S. government-backed loans and loan guarantees  is essential to its ability to maintain a competitive edge. In a statement  to Subsidyscope, Boeing said, \"[t]he U.S. aerospace industry repeatedly  demonstrates its ability to compete in the global marketplace. But as  evidenced by the current global economic turmoil, financing markets  are very volatile, and the commercial markets' support for export financing  can be unpredictable and inconsistent. To be able to compete under such  market conditions, aerospace exporting success hinges on the continuity  of crucial export credit financing that Ex-Im and other national export  credit agencies provide during market ebbs and flows.&quot; In <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/12927/000119312509022654/d10k.htm\">Boeing's 2008  Form 10-K</a>, submitted to the Securities and Exchange  Commission, it notes that sales to foreign customers accounted for about  40 percent of the company's revenues in 2008.</p>\n\n  <p>The Ex-Im Bank is not the only  entity that subsidizes exports; other U.S. federal agencies and state  governments, as well as foreign export credit agencies (ECAs) and governments  also offer export assistance. On September 4, 2009, a panel of the World  Trade Organization&mdash;an international body governing trade between nations&mdash;issued  a preliminary ruling in a dispute between the United States and the  European Union (EU) involving Boeing's main rival, Airbus. Acting  on a complaint brought by the U.S. trade representative in October 2004,  the panel held that European nations had illegally subsidized Airbus,  which is headquartered in France. Still unresolved is an <a href=\"http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2007/april/tradoc_134245.pdf\">EU complaint</a> alleging that Chicago-based Boeing  had received illegal subsidies from several U.S. agencies, including  the Department of Defense and NASA, and the states of Washington, Kansas  and Illinois. A ruling in that case is expected in 2010.</p>\n\n  <p>Despite these legal challenges, the U.S. and EU have remained  in agreement on the use of export credits, like Ex-Im loan guarantees,  for large commercial aircraft; as a result, the EU did not reference  Ex-Im in its complaint against Boeing. In its statement to Subsidyscope,  Boeing noted that Ex-Im is among &quot;numerous [ECAs] operated by industrialized  nations on behalf of their exporters&quot; and said that Airbus benefits  from ECAs in France, England and Germany.</p>\n\n  <p>While many industrialized nations  use export subsidies to boost their domestic exports and remain competitive  internationally, a <a href=\"http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/98-568_20090317.pdf\">recent  report</a> by the Congressional  Research Service notes that some Ex-Im critics &quot;doubt that a nation  can improve its welfare or level of employment over the long run by  subsidizing exports.&quot; These critics maintain that such activity  &quot;merely shifts production among sectors within the economy, but  does not add to the overall level of economic activity, and subsidizes  foreign consumption at the expense of the domestic economy,&quot; according  to the report.</p>\n\n  <p>Ex-Im no longer receives direct  appropriations from Congress. Its revenue comes from fees it charges  when it makes loans or guarantees and from insurance premiums. (Insurance  is provided mainly to small businesses for short-term transactions.)  At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Treasury Department issues  interest-free warrants allowing the bank to draw funds. Ex-Im repays  Treasury as the fees and premiums come in; in 2009, repayment was completed  by March, halfway through the fiscal year.</p>\n\n  <p>By guaranteeing a loan, Ex-Im  agrees to pay a claim if there is a default. Since 1992, the default  rate for all Ex-Im programs has been 1.03 percent. There have been four  defaults on Ex-Im guaranteed loans for Boeing planes since March 1999.  Bank officials say that Ex-Im paid $565.8 million in claims as a result  of those defaults, but had recovered from the same transactions, as of September 30, 2009, $604  million as a result of interest paid by borrowers. </p>\n\n  <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy09/cr_supp.html\">Federal Credit Supplement</a>, published by the Office of Management  and Budget, <a href=\"/glossary/#subsidy-rate\">subsidy  rates</a> for Ex-Im  guarantees and insurance in fiscal year 2008 were either quite low (1.41  percent for the riskiest transactions) or negative (-2.46 percent for  safer ones). Ex-Im assigns risk ratings to each of its transactions  based on a number of factors, including but not limited to the financial  condition of the borrower, the industry in which the borrower competes,  the country in which the project is located and the financial structure  of the transaction.</p>\n\n  <p><a href=\"http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/98-568_20090317.pdf\">With  an annual budget of $200 million, and making up less than 1 percent  of U.S. exports annually</a>,  Ex-Im is not a significant international trade actor. Further, the costs  of providing support to Ex-Im beneficiaries do not negatively affect  the budget deficit like many other federal subsidies.

It is the second time in the fund's history that it has fallen below zero. (In 1991, the Fund's balance dropped to <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/insurance/prepay/index.html\">$-7 billion</a>.) The <a href=\"http://www2.fdic.gov/qbp/2009sep/qbp.pdf\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced</a> last week that the fund had dropped from $10.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, to $-8.2 billion, as of September 30. \n</p><p>\n<p><b>October 2, 2009</b> \u2013 In an unprecedented move this week, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/news/board/Sept29no3.pdf\">is asking banks to prepay</a> their quarterly fees for the next three years in order to stem steady losses to the fund that backs accounts when an insured bank or thrift fails. Ordinarily, financial institutions pay fees to the FDIC each quarter to support the fund, which insures deposits at banks and thrifts up to $250,000.\n</p><p>\n<a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/insurance/prepay/index.html\">According to the latest FDIC estimates</a>, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) went into the red on Sept. 30. FDIC officials stressed that deposit insurance coverage is unaffected by a negative balance in the DIF.\n</p><p>\nWhen a bank fails, the FDIC protects depositors using FDIC cash resources, which includes assets and securities, and a yet-to-be-tapped $500 billion line of credit with the Treasury Department. The DIF balance is similar to a cash position, or a statement of the amount of cash a firm has at a specific point in time, said FDIC spokesman Andrew Gray.\n</p><p>\nThe DIF is projected to <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/news/board/Sept29no1.pdf\">remain in the red</a> until 2012 primarily because of an accounting mechanism the FDIC is using to keep track of the prepayments.  The FDIC Board of Directors said that if banks prepay their fees for the fourth quarter of 2009, and all of 2010, 2011, 2012 \u2013 by December 30 of this year, along with their regularly scheduled third quarter fee payment, the FDIC will have an additional $45 billion to cover bank failures. This is approximately the amount the Deposit Insurance Fund held prior to the global financial crisis. \n</p><p>\nSubsidyscope has been keeping track of each <a href=\"/projects/bailout/fdic/bank-failures/table/\">bank and thrift failure as it happens</a>. Since June 30, <a href=\"/projects/bailout/fdic/bank-failures/table/\">Subsidyscope estimates</a> that the fund has diminished an additional $14.9 billion with the failure of 44 financial institutions. There have been 89 bank failures this year.\n</p><p>\nFDIC Chairman <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2009/pr09178.html\">Sheila C. Bair said this week</a> that there is enough liquidity in the banking sector to cover the proposed mandatory prepayment.\n</p><p>\n\"The decision \u2026 is really about how and when the industry fulfills its obligation to the insurance fund,\" Bair said. \"In choosing this path, it should be clear to the public that the industry will not simply tap the shoulder of the increasingly weary taxpayer.\" \n</p><p>\nThe proposed prepayment rule includes a clause that allows the FDIC to exercise discretion and exempt certain institutions from prepayment if it would significantly impair the institution\u2019s liquidity or create a significant hardship. The names and number of exempted institutions will not be made public. Requiring prepaid assessments would also not preclude the FDIC from changing assessment rates or from further revising the risk-based assessment system from 2009-2012.\n</p><p>\nIn addition to regular fees, the FDIC has also imposed an emergency fee this year which brought in $5.6 billion. The fund\u2019s <a href=\"/glossary/#line-of-credit\">line of credit</a> from the U.S. Treasury could also be tapped if fees were insufficient to cover losses. History shows that support from the Treasury can be important. In the 1980s, a separate Treasury-backed fund that insured deposits in savings and loans became insolvent, a victim of a thrift crisis that, by some estimates, cost taxpayers about $125 billion. That fund was abolished in 1989.

Users may search by airport name, code or state, and sort findings by NPR (ranging from 0 to 100, with higher numbers being the highest-priority projects), congressional district or whether funding came through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>\n<p>Derived in part from a Freedom of Information Act request, the database includes information on enplanements&mdash;the number of paying passengers who board scheduled airlines or charter planes&mdash;to give users a sense of the level of commercial activity at a particular airport. To provide a more complete picture, it also includes data on operations&mdash;takeoffs and landings of air carrier, air taxi, general aviation and military aircraft&mdash;when such numbers are available.</p>\n<p>The AIP, a $3.5 billion program in FY 2008, funds work that enhances safety, protects the environment or otherwise improves the nation\u2019s aviation system. AIP grants support runway construction, taxiway rehabilitation and many other types of projects. By design, the program results in cross-subsidies. For instance, many  projects at non-commercial airports are partially financed using tax revenue from commercial passenger tickets. \n</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0px;\">FAA data show: <ul class=\"bulleted\">\n<li>Within the past five years, the FAA funded 3,139 projects (out of a total of 18,771) with NPRs below 41, cited by the agency as the threshold for discretionary AIP grants (no threshold is set for formula-driven entitlement grants, although the FAA says it considers how an airport uses entitlement money in deciding whether to award discretionary funds). Of the nearly $2 billion obligated for these low-priority projects, 30 percent came in the form of discretionary funding, 65 percent in entitlement funding and 5 percent in stimulus funding. According to the FAA, a priority rating is \u201cone of several tools\u201d it uses to assess projects. However, it adds, \u201c[t]he NPR is the first evaluation factor and serves to categorize airport development in accordance with agency goals and objectives.\u201d The AIP projects that scored below 41 represent nearly 17 percent of all approved projects during the five-year period.\n</li>\n<li>Eleven airports received total AIP allotments exceeding $100,000 per paying passenger from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2008. General aviation airports, \u201creliever\u201d airports near large commercial airports, and small commercial airports have received about one quarter of all AIP funding&mdash;about $4.5 billion of almost $18 billion&mdash;over the past five years.</li>\n<li>In terms of absolute dollars awarded, Los Angeles International Airport fared best during the five-year period, receiving $280 million through the AIP. It was followed by Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport ($262 million), Seattle-Tacoma International Airport ($235 million) and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport  ($209 million). </li>\n<li> Of more than $1 billion in AIP grants awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act from mid-March through mid-September 2009, Alaska received $82 million, more than any other state. California followed with $71 million. Among the stimulus-related projects in Alaska were a new $14.7 million airport for the community of Ouzinkie (population 225 as of the 2000 census); a new $14 million airport for Akiachak (population 585), and the $10 million rehabilitation of a runway in Allakaket (population 97).</li></ul></p>\n<h4>AIP Background and Controversy</h4>\n<p>\nCreated by Congress in 1982, the AIP was meant to aid the \"planning and development of public-use airports that are included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS),\" a biennial list of more than 3,400 existing and proposed airports that are \"significant to national air transportation,\" <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/airports/aip/overview/\">according to the FAA</a>. For large and medium airports, AIP grants cover 75 percent of the cost of eligible projects (80 percent for noise-abatement projects). For smaller airports, 95 percent of eligible costs are covered.</p>\n<p>Critics of the AIP assert that too much funding goes to non-commercial airports, which have few enplanements. The program gets its money from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is supported by taxes on passenger tickets and aviation fuel, mostly generated by airlines using large or medium-sized commercial airports.  Others, however, say that enplanements aren\u2019t the only measure of an airport\u2019s value. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jaa.aero/AirSys/CF.aspx\">Cecil Field</a> in Jacksonville, Fla., for example, which received $270,063 in AIP funds for each enplanement from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2008, has four runways used by general aviation, corporate, cargo and National Guard aircraft. Closed by the military in 1999, it has used its AIP money to convert to a civilian facility.</p>\n<h5>Airports Receiving Top Dollars Per Enplanement, FY2005-2008</h5>\n<table id=\"subsidy-charts\" style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:5px; border-right: 1px solid #DDDDDD; border-bottom: 1px solid #DDDDDD;\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t<tr class=\"header-row\"><td>Airport</td><td>City</td><td>State</td><td>Service Level*</td><td>$/Enplanement Ratio</td></tr>\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/O89/\">Fall River Mills</a></td><td> Fall River Mills</td><td>CA</td><td> GA</td><td>$271,825</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/VQQ/\">Cecil Field</a></td><td>Jacksonville</td><td>FL</td><td>GA</td><td>$270,063</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/AVQ/\">Marana Regional</a></td><td>Tucson</td><td>AZ</td><td>R</td><td>$235,306</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/OWA/\">Owatonna Degner Regional </a></td><td>Owatonna</td><td>MN</td><td>GA</td><td>$230,934</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/AUM/\">Austin Municipal</a></td><td>Austin</td><td>MN</td><td>GA</td><td>$222,549</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/AEG/\">Double Eagle II </a></td><td>Albuquerque</td><td>NM</td><td>R</td><td>$208,790</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/FFC/\">Peachtree City-Falcon Field</a></td><td>Atlanta</td><td>GA</td><td>GA</td><td>$187,161</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/SBD/\">San Bernardino International </a></td><td>San Bernardino </td><td>CA</td><td>R</td><td>$168,726</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/RAL/\">Riverside Municipal</a></td><td>Riverside </td><td>CA</td><td>R</td><td>$153,703</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/DRI/\">Beauregard Regional</a></td><td>DeRidder </td><td>LA</td><td>GA</td><td>$136,648</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/STF/\">George M Bryan </a></td><td>Starkville</td><td>MS</td><td>GA</td><td>$102,268</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/DIJ/\">Driggs-Reed Memorial</a></td><td>Driggs</td><td>ID</td><td>GA</td><td>$99,324</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/SGT/\">Stuttgart Municipal</a></td><td>Stuttgart </td><td>AR</td><td>GA</td><td>$97,644</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/MER/\">Castle</a></td><td>Merced </td><td>CA</td><td>GA</td><td>$97,316</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/S67/\">Nampa Municipal</a></td><td>Nampa </td><td>ID</td><td>GA</td><td>$96,190</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/TAD/\">Perry Stokes</a></td><td>Trinidad</td><td>CO</td><td>GA</td><td>$92,953</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/ADM/\">Ardmore Municipal</a></td><td>Ardmore </td><td>OK</td><td>GA</td><td>$89,737</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/SEM/\">Craig Field</a></td><td>Selma</td><td>AL</td><td>GA</td><td>$89,373</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/TCC/\">Tucumcari Municipal</a></td><td> Tucumcari</td><td>NM</td><td>GA</td><td>$81,338</td></tr>\t\n\t<tr><td><a href=\"/projects/transportation/aip/airports/LKR/\">Lancaster County-Mc Whirter Field</a></td><td>Lancaster</td><td>SC</td><td>GA</td><td>$73,828</td></tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table><cite style=\"display:block; margin-bottom: 20px;\">Source: Subsidyscope analysis of FAA data.<br />\n*GA = General Aviation; R = Reliever</cite>\n<p>FAA data for fiscal year 2005, the most recent year available, show that U.S. passenger airlines accounted for 64 percent of the tax revenue that went into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, compared with 3 percent for general aviation.

Small commercial and general aviation airports received 64 percent. In a statement to Subsidyscope, the FAA said that general aviation \"accounts for more than 90 percent of the roughly 240,000 civil aircraft registered in the United States.  The general aviation airports included in the FAA\u2019s National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems provide the closest source of air transportation for about 19 percent of the population and are particularly important to rural areas.\"</p>\n<p>The disproportionate allocation of AIP money to general aviation airports is tempered somewhat by the FAA\u2019s approval of  passenger facility charges&mdash;not to be confused with ticket taxes&mdash;of either $3 or $4.50 at <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/airports/pfc/monthly_reports/media/airports.pdf\">378 airports with commercial service</a>.

Money is dispensed both through an entitlement fund, which uses formulas to identify high-priority projects such as safety-related runway expansions, and a discretionary fund, which is less restrictive but contains certain set-asides for noise-abatement projects and military airports. A relatively small portion of AIP funding comes in the form of earmarks.

This methodology is organized in three parts. First, it describes the important difference between measuring spending on programs that contain subsidies and measuring actual subsidies. Second, it describes, in four steps, how Subsidyscope identifies programs that contain subsidies. Third, it describes how Subsidyscope collects spending data on these programs and, where available, data on subsidies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>A. Subsidies and Programs That Contain Subsidies</h5>\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to measure subsidies, one must identify those programs that produce them.  Unfortunately, there is no single definition of the term \u201csubsidy\u201d and people disagree about which federal programs do or do not produce subsidies. In order to inform our thinking, Subsidyscope uses, as a starting point, the <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05734sp.pdf\" >Government Accountability Office\u2019s definition</a> of \"subsidy\":</p>\r\n<blockquote><em>\r\nGenerally, a payment or benefit made by the federal government where the benefit exceeds the cost to the beneficiary. Subsidies are designed to support the conduct of an economic enterprise or activity \u2026. They may also refer to (1) provisions in the tax laws for certain tax expenditures and (2) the provision of loans, goods, and services to the public at prices lower than market value. These include interest subsidies.</em>\r\n</blockquote><p>\r\nEven this definition is quite general, and as straightforward as it may sound, interpreting it is not a simple task.  Subsidies are not often discernable line items in the federal budget; rather, the subsidy is a portion of the amount spent on programs that provide subsidies.  The amount spent on programs containing subsidies is, in turn, a subset of all government spending (see the figure below). Within total government spending, Subsidyscope first identifies spending on government programs that contain subsidies.  \r\n</p>\r\n<h6 style=\"text-align:center; \">Subsidies are a subset of programs that contain subsidies; these programs are, in turn, a subset of all government programs<br />(for illustration only, not based on actual data)</h6>\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 1.1em; background-color:#a7d5e8; width:50%; height: 150px;border: 1px solid black; margin:20px auto ;padding:10px;\">All government programs <div style=\"border:1px solid black; margin: 20px; padding:10px; float:right; background-color:#ecc6b4;width:50%; height:50%;\">Programs containing subsidies <div style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:10px; margin: 10px;float:right; background-color:#cccbec;width:50%;\">Subsidy Spending</div></div></div>\r\n<p>Defining what government programs provide a subsidy is a matter of judgment. Determining what activities \u201csupport the conduct of an economic enterprise or activity\u201d as the GAO definition suggests can be difficult. For instance, some government activities provide specific benefits to specific people, not to an \u201centerprise or activity.\u201d Governments may also indirectly support an economic activity while in pursuit of a broad or diffuse policy goal, such as public safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNot all spending on programs that provide a subsidy translates into a subsidy.  The subsidy is the net monetary benefit a recipient receives from a program.<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a>  In some cases this may be significantly less than what the federal program actually spends.  For example, a policy holder of federal flood insurance may receive $10,000 from the government to cover a claim.  While the federal government has spent $10,000, the net benefit to the policy holder would be less if the policy holder paid insurance premiums to the government before filing the claim. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnless a government agency or some other entity calculates what portion of spending on subsidy programs is a subsidy, the exact amount of subsidy may be unknown. Subsidyscope presents government data on the programs that contain subsidies, and data on specific subsidies, when available. When subsidy estimates do not exist, we present the amount of spending on the programs containing subsidies, providing an upper bound for the estimate of the <i>actual</i> subsidy. However, government data quality issues explored further <a href=\"http://subsidyscope.com/data-quality/\">here</a> lead us to believe that the estimates we provide for spending on programs that contain a subsidy are <i>lower bound</i> estimates for the total spending.   \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is important to note this project does not include all government subsidies. First, Subsidyscope only looks at federal programs. Subsidies provided by state or local governments are not considered unless they originate from federal funding. Second, subsidies provided by regulations or tariffs are generally not included in the scope of the project. Finally, Subsidyscope is not attempting to measure negative subsidies (e.g., excise taxes). Some or all of these categories may be added in the future. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>B.  Identification of Programs That Contain Subsidies</h5>\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to estimate spending on programs that provide subsidies and the subsidies they produce, Subsidyscope must identify what federal programs contain subsidies.  To do this, Subsidyscope follows a four-step process.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;display: block;\">Categories of Subsidy Programs.</span>\r\n<br />\r\nThe federal government can deliver subsidies six different ways.  These are listed below.  Subsidyscope starts our process by looking for government sources of subsidy information in the first four categories on this list.   <br /><br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc; font-size:100%;\">\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">grants (a direct expenditure);</li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">contracts (a direct expenditure);</li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">tax expenditures;</li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">risk transfers;</li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">regulatory subsidies; and</li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">tariffs/excise taxes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"font-size:100%;\">Direct expenditures include direct transfers of money (e.g., cash <a href=\"/grants/\">grants</a>) or goods and services (e.g., donation of government surplus).<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a>  Government <a href=\"/contracts/\">contracts</a> are used to provide services for the government, either on behalf of the government or for the government directly. Under a contract, a subsidy generally occurs when the government pays more than fair market value for a good or service. Subsidyscope presumes that competed contracts\u2014contracts that are subject to an open bidding process\u2014generally do not have a subsidy component, even though the bidding process may include certain preferences, such as for minority-owned businesses. Therefore, we focus our data presentation on non-competed contracts. <a href=\"/tax-subsidies/\">Tax expenditures</a> provide tax relief to certain parties by allowing special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, special credits, preferential rates or deferrals of liability, before taxes are calculated. <a href=\"/loans/\">Risk transfers</a> convey financial risk from recipients to the federal government through insurance contracts, loans, loan guarantees and similar instruments.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a>   \r\n\r\n</p><p style=\"font-size:100%;\">\r\nImportantly, the last two categories of subsidies, <em>regulatory subsidies</em> and <em>tariffs/excise taxes</em>, are generally not measured by Subsidyscope. Regulations affect market prices and have the effect of subsidizing firms or individuals that are not regulated or can help existing firms that are regulated by discouraging new competition. Likewise, tariffs and excise taxes \u2013 or fees charged on certain goods \u2013 are a negative subsidy, discouraging the purchase of goods subject to the tariffs or tax. While Subsidyscope recognizes that they can have a significant impact on economic behavior, these categories are currently excluded from our scope to keep the project manageable.  Subsidy information on regulations, tariffs and excise taxes may be added in the future.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;display: block;\">Sector Selection</span><br />\r\n<p style=\"font-size:100%;\">Second, Subsidyscope selects a particular economic sector on which to focus. In order to define a sector in a way that lends itself to data collection and aggregation, we begin by using established federal budget functions to define sectors. (An exception to this, the nonprofit sector, is described in the paragraph below.) Using budget functions makes it easier to define the scope of a sector and identify federal programs in that sector. For instance, the transportation sector is budget function 400 and the energy sector is budget function 270.  However, there are many exceptions as some activities within a sector cut across multiple budget functions. We use a variety of means to identify these cross-cutting programs and apportion their costs to appropriate sectors.</p>\r\n<p  style=\"font-size:100%;\">Subsidyscope examined one sector that is not defined by a budget function: the nonprofit sector. Subsidyscope is an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trusts and is implemented in conjunction with the Sunlight Foundation.  Like other nonprofits, the Pew Charitable Trusts and Sunlight benefit from federal subsidies. However, since there is no budget function for nonprofits, these subsidies might otherwise be spread out among other sectors or not covered at all. Subsidyscope treats nonprofits as a separate sector.  Thus, Subsidyscope provides the same detail and summary subsidy information for nonprofits as it provides for other sectors. The parameters used to define this sector are described on the nonprofit sector <a href=\"/nonprofits/summary/\">summary page</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;display: block;\">Identification of Federal Programs in a Sector</span><br />\r\n<p style=\"font-size:100%;\">Third, the Subsidyscope team identifies federal programs in a selected sector (e.g., transportation) by using the first four categories, created in the first step above, and various government data sources.  This is done as follows:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc; font-size:100%;\">\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">Direct expenditure programs are identified from the <em>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</em> (CFDA) first using budget functions, and second, using the CFDA functional index to further identify cross-cutting programs that may pertain to a specific sector. Subsidyscope manually sorts the programs in the functional index to determine whether to include those programs in the sector. </li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">Contracts for a sector are identified from the Federal Procurement Data System, which is a part of USAspending.gov.  We use North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes to identify the appropriate economic sector, or Product Service Codes, if NAICS codes are not available.</li><li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">Tax expenditure programs are identified from the <i>Analytical Perspectives</i> volume of the President\u2019s Budget. </li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">Risk transfer programs are identified from the <i>Analytical Perspectives</i> volume and the <i>Federal Credit Supplement</i> of the President\u2019s Budget, and other agency-specific sources. </li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"font-size:100%;\">Using this information, Subsidyscope compiles a list of federal programs (including contracts but excluding regulations, tariffs and excise taxes) that are directed at a particular sector of the economy.  </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;display: block;\">Identification of Programs That Contain a Subsidy</span><br/>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-size:100%;\">Finally, having identified the federal programs within a specific sector that may fall into one of the four subsidy categories, Subsidyscope identifies the subset of these programs that are likely to contain a subsidy. </p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/media/images/charts/methodology_flowchart.png\"/>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-size:100%;\">Subsidyscope uses a decision tree (shown above) to identify those federal activities that are likely to contain a subsidy.  The decision tree categorizes activities of the federal government based on both the type of activity and the characteristics that define a subsidy.  For instance, some federal activities, such as the collection of tariffs, fall outside the current purview of the project and, therefore, are not categorized as activities that include a subsidy component for the purpose of Subsidyscope analyses.  Activities within the scope of the project are sorted through a cascading set of options which help identify the type of activity (e.g., contract, risk transfer or tax expenditure) and whether or not that activity meets two important characteristics of a subsidy as defined by GAO: (1) does it result in a net benefit to the beneficiary and (2) does is it support the conduct of an economic activity? </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-size:100%;\">It is important to note that the decision tree does not eliminate the need for judgment.  Some judgments are built into the tree.  For instance, the decision tree assumes all tax expenditures provided to entities other than individuals (e.g., corporations) contain a subsidy component. It also assumes that all federal contracts provided at \u2018market value\u2019, but where that market is constrained (e.g., not open to full competition) are more likely to contain a subsidy component.  Other judgments must be made in this sorting process.  Most notably in many cases a decision must be made whether or not a federal activity supports \u201cthe conduct of an economic enterprise or activity.\u201d  In some cases this is not a difficult question.  For instance, a federal tax credit for buying residential solar panels clearly supports undertaking an economic activity (the production of solar panels).  But other cases are not as clear.  Does a federal grant to a police department to generally promote automobile safety, including the option to use some of the money to purchase child car seats for low income families, constitute supporting \u201cthe conduct of an economic enterprise or activity\u201d?  In this case Subsidyscope decided it did not, because the purchase of car seats seemed a small and optional part of the overall program which did not otherwise seem to support any other economic activity. But others could disagree with this answer. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-size:100%;\">Subsidyscope\u2019s data set does not preclude others from using our decision tree or their own judgment to come up with different conclusions. In order to provide wide usability, and to account for different interpretations, we present all government direct expenditure data within a sector in our search tools, except in the area of contracts [see more in Sec. C below]. This allows users to, for instance, include any programs in their database search and count them as subsidies or omit other programs that we have excluded. In this way, users may make their own judgments, or change the scope of their research, and conduct their own analyses.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</p>\r\n<h5>C. Estimating Spending on Subsidies and Programs That Contain Subsidies </h5>\r\n<p>Having identified federal programs that are likely to contain a subsidy in a sector, Subsidyscope obtains estimates of the amount spent on these programs and the amount of subsidy delivered to the recipients, where available. This is done by mining different government databases and documents. The sources depend on the category of the program as defined in sub-section B.1. above, and requires a different process of determining subsidies for each type of federal spending.</p>\r\n<p>Direct expenditures on <a href=\"/grants/\">grant</a> programs are often the easiest on which to collect data. However, subsidies delivered through direct expenditures are often the most difficult to identify, given that not all of the money spent through direct expenditures is a subsidy, and measuring the subsidy requires economic data that may or may not be available (such as a market price in the absence of government spending). </p>\r\n<p>To that end, Subsidyscope presents the grant data obtained through USAspending.gov in a way that allows users to sort the data across various categories. The data are already classified by the government according to assistance type (grants, direct payment, loan guarantee, etc.), as well as by recipient type (state, county, nonprofit, etc.). It is important to note that most spending data presented are obligations. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nData on government <a href=\"/contracts/\">contracts</a> are pulled from USAspending.gov, which houses the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). Subsidyscope does not attempt to determine which contracts have a subsidy component or measure what that component may be. We do presume, however, that competed contracts\u2014contracts that are subject to an open bidding process\u2014generally do not have a subsidy component, even though the bidding process may include certain preferences. Thus, we concentrate on those contracts that are non-competed and make this information available to the public. This does not mean non-competed contracts contain a significant subsidy, only that it is more likely to be the case.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur definition of \u201cnon-competed contracts\" includes all six categories of non-competed/constrained competition in FPDS (all categories except \u201cA Full & Open Competition,\u201d \u201cF Competed under Simplified Acquisition Threshold\u201d and \u201cCDO Competitive Delivery Order\u201d).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nContracts data are presented separately from grants and should be viewed with additional caution for at least three reasons. First, many contracts, even those where competition is limited, are awarded at close to fair market value such that the actual subsidy provided may be low or zero. Second, Subsidyscope is unable to use budget functions to organize these data into sectors. As mentioned above, we are using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes to identify the appropriate economic sector, or Product Service Codes, if NAICS codes are not available. Because contracts cannot be sorted by budget function, Subsidyscope is reluctant to combine contract data with expenditure data. Finally, Subsidyscope has found the quality of contract data in USAspending.gov to be very poor. For instance, despite there being a requirement that contracting officers identify NAICS codes for each contract, in 2008 approximately half the contract records are missing NAICS codes. This lowers our confidence in the contract data.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>For <a href=\"/tax-subsidy/\">tax expenditures</a>, Subsidyscope uses data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s estimates presented in the <em>Analytical Perspectives</em> of the President\u2019s Budget. As previously noted, the subsidy provided through a tax expenditure may not be 100 percent of the estimated revenue loss of the tax expenditure. For example, certain tax expenditures place compliance costs on the recipient which may reduce the value of the tax expenditure. However, compliance costs are not calculated, therefore Subsidyscope presents the entire amount of a tax expenditure as a tax subsidy.</p>\r\n<p>Estimated credit subsidies provided through <a href=\"/loans/\">risk transfers</a> come from a number of sources, including the <em>Analytical Perspectives</em> volume and the <em>Federal Credit Supplement</em> of the President\u2019s Budget, and other agency-specific sources. Under the Federal Credit Reform Act, the federal government requires the subsidy costs of loans and loan guarantees to be estimated and presented in the budget. Estimates of subsidies provided through insurance programs are not required and thus harder to find.  Subsidyscope will include such estimates when they are available. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data on government contracts are pulled from USAspending.gov, which houses the Federal Procurement Data System. These data are presented separately from the other categories and should be viewed with additional caution for at least three reasons.  First, many contracts, even those where competition is limited, are awarded at close to fair market value such that the actual subsidy provided may be low or zero.  Second, Subsidyscope is unable to use budget functions to organize these data into sectors.  As mentioned above, we are using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes to identify the appropriate economic sector, or Product Service Codes, if NAICS codes are not available.  Because contracts cannot be sorted by budget function, Subsidyscope is reluctant to combine contract data with expenditure data.  Finally, Subsidyscope has found the quality of contract data in USAspending.gov to be very poor.  For instance, despite there being a requirement that contracting officers identify NAICS codes for each contract, in 2008 approximately half the contract records are missing NAICS codes.  This lowers our confidence in the contract data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, all of Subsidyscope\u2019s estimates of subsidy spending and subsidies rely on the quality of data provided by the government databases.  Overall we believe the estimates of spending on grant programs and contracts to be lower bounds due to missing data in federal data sets; however, it is important to reiterate that these spending estimates represent upper bounds for the subsidy estimates contained within those grant programs or contracts. <a href=\"http://subsidyscope.com/data-quality/\">To the extent these data are found to be of poor quality or omit important information</a>, Subsidyscope will attempt to obtain more accurate information directly from agencies or other sources of raw data. For graphic presentations of data on our site where we know the omissions are significant, such as subsidy estimates for direct expenditures, we will not supply an estimate but insert a question mark or a statement such as \"subsidy unknown.\"</p>\r\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\r\n<li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>Some argue that a government subsidy occurs when the government fails to correct problems that result in certain goods or services being under- or over-priced.  For instance, they argue that a government\u2019s failure to adequately reduce greenhouse gas emissions results in coal being under priced; resulting in a subsidy for coal companies. Subsidyscope does not take this approach.  In practice, it would be very difficult to identify and measure unaddressed market failures.

The California Zephyr, which runs from Chicago to San Francisco, had the second-highest per passenger subsidy of $193 and carried nearly 353,000 passengers in 2008. Pew's analysis indicates that the average loss per passenger on all 44 of Amtrak\u2019s lines was $32, about four times what the loss would be using Amtrak's figures: only $8 per passenger.

Our analysis is based on <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06145.pdf\">a 2005 Government Accountability Office (GAO) critique</a> of Amtrak\u2019s accounting methods, which says the railroad should consider depreciation when calculating profitability.

The analysis, prompted by a <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06145.pdf\">Government Accountability Office</a> report, goes two steps beyond Amtrak\u2019s own assessment of its performance. First, Subsidyscope calculated each route\u2019s per passenger costs by dividing the overall profit or loss for that route by the number of riders it had. This, in our view, gives a more complete picture of the resources each route requires.

From early colonial voluntary organizations to the 1.8 million<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</A> nonprofits that exist today, many of these groups have been vital to providing basic community services. In the United States, nonprofit organizations predate the American republic.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a> When European settlers first began migrating to America, voluntary and charitable organizations, such as hospitals, orphanages and fire departments were established to fulfill unmet social needs.  While nonprofits in colonial times were primarily religious organizations, the eventual separation of church and state, and changing public needs, required nonprofits to adapt and evolve as well.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a> The following overview briefly summarizes key characteristics of the nonprofit sector in order to provide context for interpreting subsidy-related data.</p>\n\n<h4>Economic Rationale for the Sector</h4>\n\n<p>Economists often see nonprofits as one solution to \"market failure\"&mdash;the idea that there are collective goods, or public goods, which are not profitable enough for businesses to provide them at the rate the public needs or wants them.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a> For example, education provides benefits to society that exceed those that can be accurately valued in a market transaction.<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a> As a result education is undervalued, and thus underprovided, in a market economy that relies on profits to motivate behavior. Nonprofit education organizations, entities not motivated by financial gain, can make up the market shortfall. This type of market failure provides an economic rationale for government to subsidize businesses or nonprofit organizations to encourage the greater production of undervalued goods and services. </p>\n\n<p>Economic theories also engage the notion of \"government failure\"&mdash;the failure of government to adequately provide certain services because it does not have the resources to do so or because there is an inadequate political will for their provision.<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a> Partnerships between nonprofits and the government may be one way to more adequately provide such services by bringing more resources and will to bear on a specific need.</p>\n\n<p>Just as there are a wide array of types and sizes of nonprofit organizations, there are also multiple ways to analyze and assess nonprofits. Subsidyscope is primarily interested in their status as recipients of government funds or benefits that may contain subsidies. We make no attempt to assess the efficacy of government spending in the sector or make any value judgments regarding the sector. </p>\n\n<h4>Scope of the Sector</h4>\n\n<p>While nonprofits have a long history and continually evolving relationship with government, today the sector is primarily defined by its tax exempt status.<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a> However, there is no single agreed upon definition of a \u201cnonprofit,\u201d a concern voiced by many doing data collection and analysis of the sector. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines nonprofits broadly as any organization that is tax-exempt under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and lists those organizations under section 501(c).<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a> Subsidyscope uses this definition in its assessment of the nonprofit sector.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a></p>\n\n<p>A list of all types of organizations considered tax exempt under 501(c) is presented at the end of this document. The organizations listed under section 501(c)(3), generally known as \u201cpublic charities,\u201d include religious organizations, hospitals, universities and charities.  Public charities, as well the organizations under section 501(c)(4), which include civic leagues, social welfare organizations, and certain local associations of employees, make up the majority of the formal nonprofit sector.<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a></p>\n\n<h4>Tax Requirements of the Nonprofit Sector</h4>\n\n<p>Different Internal Revenue Service (IRS) registration and filing documents supply various financial data depending on the type of nonprofit. Thus, to study the whole sector the data must be carefully aggregated. However, the tax filings and other sources of information do allow some description of the overall sector.</p>\n\n<p>Nonprofit organizations with over $5,000 in annual gross income are required to register with the IRS.<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a> Religious organizations do not have to register with the IRS for the purpose of getting the tax exemption, though the Urban Institute notes that about half of them do so.<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a> To claim tax-exempt status, nonprofits that have annual gross receipts of $25,000 or higher must file a Form 990 with the IRS every year,<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a> which provides important data regarding the different categories of nonprofits and their relative size. Churches and certain religious organizations, no matter their receipts, are not required to file a Form 990 to receive tax-exempt status.</p>\n\n<p>Private foundations, which also are considered 501(c)(3) organizations, must file a Form 990-PF.<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a> Private foundations usually are endowed by a founding individual, family or corporation, and typically fund public charities, \u201cthough they also provide scholarships, support government activities, or operate programs.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a> Finally, a nonprofit organization operating a business that makes over $1,000 in annual gross income that is not substantially related to its charitable mission is required to file an unrelated business income tax return called Form 990-T.<a href=\"#footnote-16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a> In 2006, nearly $11.3 billion in gross unrelated business income was reported to the IRS on nonprofits\u2019 returns, however, after deductions those nonprofits only paid taxes on an estimated $1.28 billion in unrelated business income.<a href=\"#footnote-17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"inline-image floatr\" style=\"width: 450px;\">\n<img src=\"/media/images/nonprofits/nonprofit_entities_by_type.png\"/>\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope, using data from GAO, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-193\">Nonprofit Sector: Significant Federal Funds Reach the Sector through Various Mechanisms, but More Complete and Reliable Funding Data are Needed.</a>\u201d February 2009. p.5.</cite>\n\n<img style=\"margin-top: 25px;\" src=\"/media/images/nonprofits/nonprofit_overview_rank_by_revenue.png\"/>\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope calculation based on data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics. <a href=\"http://nccsdataweb.urban.org/PubApps/nonprofit-overview-sumRpt.php?v=nteeFilers&t=pc&f=0\">Number of 501(c)(3) Public Charities by NTEE Activities Purpose \u2013 Annual Filers Only.</a>\u201d October 2009.

The Urban Institute.</cite>\n\n</div>\n\n<h4>Size and Composition of the Sector</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the latest available data, in 2006 the nonprofit sector contributed 5 percent ($666.1 billion) to the gross domestic product and more than 8 percent ($489.4 billion) of American wages.<a href=\"#footnote-18\" class=\"footnote\">18</a> In that same year, over 1.4 million nonprofits registered with the IRS (based on their gross income).<a href=\"#footnote-18\" class=\"footnote\">19</a> The number of registered nonprofits grew from 1.4 million to nearly 1.6 million in three years (2006 - 2009). Over half of those filed a Form 990 with the IRS, and reported nearly $2 trillion in total revenue in 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a></p>\n\n<p>Regarding revenue, in 2008, the top 400 nonprofits, including foundations, brought in $76.2 billion.<a href=\"#footnote-21\" class=\"footnote\">21</a> Of those 400 organizations, 118 were colleges and universities, 53 were international groups, 34 were hospitals and medical centers and 26 were health charities.<a href=\"#footnote-22\" class=\"footnote\">22</a></p.\n\n<p>About 63 percent (1,128,367 of 1,789,554) of all tax-exempt organizations were 501(c)(3)s in fiscal year 2007 (see Figure 1).<a href=\"#footnote-23\" class=\"footnote\">23</a> The next largest category of nonprofits, 501(c)(4)s, accounted for nearly 8 percent (134,843) of all nonprofit entities that same year. About 100 of these organizations are HMOs and managed care plans or other medical or dental managed care plans and, while small in numbers, these organizations make up the vast majority of revenue and assets in the 501(c)(4) category.<a href=\"#footnote-24\" class=\"footnote\">24</a> In 2008, of those 501 (c)(4)s, there were 109,091 registered 501(c)(4)s reporting assets of $83.0 billion and revenues of $71.9 billion, according to the National Center for Charitable Statistics.<a href=\"#footnote-25\" class=\"footnote\">25</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4>Major Types of Nonprofits</h4>\n\n\n<p>Health care facilities (e.g., nonprofit hospitals), educational institutions and human services organizations were the three largest types of 501(c)(3) organizations as measured by revenue in 2007 (see Figure 2).<a href=\"#footnote-26\" class=\"footnote\">26</a> The most prevalent types of nonprofits, as measured by number, were organizations working in the arts, culture and humanities; education; and human services (see Figure 3).<a href=\"#footnote-27\" class=\"footnote\">27</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Federal Subsidies</h4>\n\n<p>While tax exempt status defines the sector, nonprofit organizations also benefit from other tax deductions, credits and exclusions in the tax code. For example, all private donations to 501(c)(3) organizations are tax exempt, meaning both the donor and recipient could receive a subsidy from the government. All of these tax benefits provide a potentially large source of federal subsidies to the nonprofit sector. Further, the federal grants, contracts and risk transfers (loans and loan guarantees) that many nonprofits receive to carry out their work may also include a subsidy component. However, it is important to note that not all of these programs do contain subsidies.

Revenues that predominantly come from users of roads (\u201cuser fees\u201d), including fuel taxes, vehicle registration fees and tolls, pay for a decreasing share of road costs. Taxes and fees not directly related to highway use (\u201cnon-user fees\u201d) and bonds are making up the difference.</p>\n\n<p>Using Federal Highway Administration statistics, Subsidyscope has calculated that in 2007, 51 percent of the nation's $193 billion set aside for highway construction and maintenance was generated through user fees\u2014down from 10 years earlier when user fees made up 61 percent of total spending on roads. The rest came from other sources, including revenue generated by income, sales and property taxes, as well as bond issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"inline-image floatr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<img title=\"Total Tax Expenditures FY2008-20014\" src=\"/media/images/transportation/highway_funds_chart.png\"/> <br/>\n<cite style=\"width:550px;display:block;\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/ohpi/hss/index.cfm\">Highway Statistics</a>, forms HF-10 and HF-210, Federal Highway Administration.</cite>\n</p>\n\n<p>Going back further, the trend is more pronounced. Forty years ago, user fees amounted to 71 percent of revenues spent on roads. Today, user fee revenue as a share of total highway-related funds is at an all-time low since the Interstate Highway System was created in 1957. A complete data set of <a href=\"/media/data/transportation/highway_funding_sources.csv\">highway revenue by source is available for download</a>.  In 2007, non-user revenues contributed $70 billion to the highway system. By comparison, this contribution totaled $26 billion in 1967 (in 2007 dollars).</p>\n\t\n<p>Not all user fees collected are made available for highway purposes. Of the 18.4 cent per gallon federal tax on gasoline, 2.86 cents are allocated specifically for mass transit projects. Another 0.1 cent per gallon is used to pay for environmental cleanup resulting from leaking fuel storage tanks. From 1990 to 1997, the federal government also set aside a portion of taxes on gasoline, diesel and other fuels to reduce budget deficits.</p> \n\n<p>However, even if those funds were fully devoted to highways, total user fee revenue accounted for only 65 percent of all funds set aside for highways in 2007, according to Subsidyscope calculations. This is down from 84 percent in 1997 and 77 percent in 1967. Subsidyscope provides a complete data set of <a href=\"/media/data/transportation/user_revenue_allocation.csv\">user fee revenues and allocations for download</a>.</p>\n\t\n<p>Various factors account for the shift in funding away from users fees.  Fuel taxes lose their buying power unless adjusted to keep pace with rising highway construction and maintenance costs.  <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/reports/2003/03transportation_puentes/gastax.pdf\">The amount of federal fuel tax allocated to highway purposes has not increased since 1997</a> and states have had trouble increasing fuel taxes to keep up with inflation.  Further, changes in driving patterns and fuel consumption can lead to unexpected dips and peaks in user revenues.  For instance, increases in fuel prices at the pump can cause vehicle owners to cut back on driving, reducing revenues. Similarly, changes in vehicle efficiency can reduce revenues available from fuel taxes while vehicle usage remains constant.</p>\n\n<p>Another major funding source for roads is borrowing through bond measures, which made up almost 13 percent of highway funds available in 2007.  This number has fluctuated over the years. Moreover, the use of bonds to fund roads varies widely from state to state.  Subsidyscope considers bonds separately from user fees and other revenue because it is not clear which sources of revenues will be used to repay the bonds.  </p>\n\n<p>In addition to a decline in user fee revenue, federal dollars have gradually declined as a share of total highway funding. As a result, state and local governments have taken on a higher share of road costs and are increasingly reliant on alternative sources of revenue.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"small\">\n<em>All data are from <a href=\"http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/ohpi/hss/index.cfm\">Highway Statistics</a>, forms HF-10 and HF-210, Federal Highway Administration.

Since 1994, MARAD has committed nearly $7.5 billion in loan guarantees for shipping projects.<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a>   Its purpose is to assist in advancing and modernizing the U.S. maritime industry through long-term financing that may be otherwise unavailable to ship owners.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a>   Between the late 1980s and early 2000s, MARAD experienced defaults of at least $2.5 billion.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a> </p>\n\n<p>The program provides a subsidy to shipyards and shipbuilders by lowering the cost of investment capital. In this case, a private lender provides a loan to the shipbuilder or shipyard and MARAD agrees to guarantee a portion of the project cost, which cannot exceed 87.5 percent of the total cost of the vessel or project, should the borrower fail to repay the loan.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a>     MARAD\u2019s guarantee allows borrowers to secure a loan at a lower interest rate than they could otherwise obtain.<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a>   A government guarantee also encourages lenders to offer loans to borrowers to whom they might not otherwise extend credit. For these reasons, shipyards and shipbuilders receive a government subsidy regardless of whether or not they default on a loan. (See <a href=\"/loans/\">this page</a> for more on subsidies through risk transfers.) </p>\n\n<p>Past Title XI projects have left a large imprint on the domestic merchant fleet. Vessels eligible for assistance generally include commercial vessels such as ferries, tankers, tugs, towboats, barges, dredges, boats for oceanographic research, offshore oil rigs and support vessels, floating power barges and dry docks. The current Jones Act fleet,<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a>  which includes nearly one-half of the U.S. Merchant Marine vessels, is comprised predominantly of vessels constructed with Title XI loan guarantees.

The data include information on loan guarantee applications approved since fiscal year 1994, encompassing 115 separate commitments for 801 shipbuilding and shipyard improvement projects.

By reducing the revenues that would otherwise have been collected by the government, tax expenditures have a similar effect on the federal deficit as government spending. As Figure 1 illustrates, in some years, the sum of tax expenditure estimates rivals discretionary outlays.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a> Note that while Subsidyscope focuses on the budgetary costs of these tax expenditures, any policy evaluation should weigh those costs against their benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"charts left\" style=\"width: 350px; margin-top: -15px; margin-right: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\r\n<h5>Figure 2: FY2009 Treasury and JCT Tax <br/> Expenditure Estimates ($ billions)</h5>\r\n<img src=\"/media/images/charts/pted/treasury_jct_comparison.png\"/>\r\n\r\n<cite>Source: Analytical Perspectives, President\u2019s Fiscal Year Budget, 2011 (Treasury) and JCS-1-10: Estimates Of Federal Tax Expenditures For Fiscal Years 2009-2013, Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). Data are for individuals and corporations and are taken from FY2009 estimates. </cite>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost of tax expenditures to the federal government are estimated by two government entities: Treasury, which is in the Executive Branch, and JCT, a Congressional committee.  Treasury and JCT use different methods and formats for calculating and presenting their estimates  (see the <a href=\"/tax_expenditures/methodology/\">Methodology</a>  for more detail). Sound budget and tax policy requires  an accessible accounting of tax expenditure estimates, so that policy makers and the public alike will be able to assess how the nation\u2019s resources are allocated through the tax code. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first data set presented here includes tax expenditures for  three economic sectors: Energy, Housing and Transportation. We will add additional sectors in the future and other features\u2014including the ability for users to aggregate tax expenditures across various categories\u2014allowing for new levels of data comparison, arrangement and analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><p><strong>Key Findings: Estimates Vary Greatly and Housing Tax Expenditures 20 Times Larger Than Energy and Transportation Combined</strong></p> <br>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc !important;\">\r\n<li>Treasury and JCT often produce different estimates of the same tax expenditure because they use different methods for calculating their estimates. For example, in the FY2011 Budget, Treasury reported $3.8 billion in revenue losses from the \"tax credit for low-income housing investments\" for FY2009, less than half of the JCT estimate of $8.3 billion for the same year.</li>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<li>Estimates of the revenue lost from a specific tax expenditure may significantly change, without explanation, from year to year. For instance, Treasury more than doubled its FY2008 estimate of revenues lost for the line item \"expensing of exploration and development costs, fuels\" between its FY2009 report and FY2010 report. In the FY2009 report the estimated revenue loss was $0.5 billion and in FY2010 it was $1.7 billion.</li>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<li>In FY2009, tax expenditures for the Housing sector were more than 20 times larger than those for the Transportation and Energy sectors, combined. According to analysis of the Treasury tax expenditure estimates, the Transportation sector contained $3.7 billion in revenue losses, followed closely by the Energy sector with $5.2 billion. The Housing sector accounted for over 18 percent of <em>total</em> federal tax expenditures in FY2009, with $185.2 billion in revenue losses.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\r\n<li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>While government data is the best available, there is uncertainty in government estimates. Each of the tax expenditures here are estimated in a static analysis, or independently of other tax expenditures, which means that interaction effects are not taken into account.

From candy bars to hybrid cars, government subsidies touch our lives every day. Some areas of the economy are deeply affected by subsidy programs. For instance, in 2007 the government spent approximately $874 billion on health care in the United States, much of it through programs that provide subsidies. This accounted for nearly half of all health care spending.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"sidebar\">\n        <h3>What is a Subsidy?</h3>\n        <p>\"A typical textbook definition of a subsidy is a transfer of economic resources by the Government to the buyer or seller of a good or service that has the effect of reducing the price paid, increasing the price received, or reducing the cost of production of the good or service.\"\"</p>\n        <span class=\"attribution\">&mdash;U. S. Energy Information Administration, 1992</span>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"sidebar\">\n        <h3>Subsidies and Subsidy Spending</h3>\n        <p>The gross amount the federal government spends on programs that contain subsidies is much higher than the amount spent on a subsidy itself. Spending on programs with subsidies includes administrative expenses that do not benefit the recipient and, therefore, are not a subsidy. Second, the subsidy is the net benefit a recipient enjoys. If a recipient must incur costs in order to qualify for a subsidy in the first place, those costs offset some of the benefits.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <p>While subsidies are a necessary means for the government to do its job, taxpayers have a right to know what happens to their money. The federal government should be able to answer questions such as: \"Who is getting subsidies?\" and \"How much are they getting?\" The current fiscal climate only heightens the need for such answers. As the federal deficit continues to swell, some difficult choices will need to be made in the coming years. In order to make informed decisions, Congress and the Administration need more accurate data on subsidy spending.</p>\n\n      <p>Today, unfortunately, federal subsidies are largely hidden. Subsidy program data are often unclear or of poor quality. A recent study by the Government Accountability Office examined spending data in the Federal Assistance Award Data System, the federal government's primary source of information on grants and other subsidies, and found that data for half of the programs were inaccurate during at least one of three years inspected. In many cases there was no spending data at all<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n      <p>In response, Subsidyscope, an initiative of The Pew Charitable Trusts, is revealing information on subsidies by building the most comprehensive source for subsidy data available. The information we compile will stimulate a more vigorous and informed debate about the full scope of federal subsidies and help policy makers make smart choices.</p>\n\n      <h3>Indispensable Subsidies</h3>\n\n      <p>Americans love freedom, and we've resisted various forms of government intervention in our affairs. We've never liked being told what to do. In 1677, American colonists chafed at a new law decreeing that any goods moved from one American port to another would face stiff duties unless carried on an English ship. The law subsidized English shippers at the expense of farmers and merchants. Demonstrating their outrage, colonists in North Carolina seized the customs house and imprisoned the customs collector.</p>\n\n      <p>Americans also love subsidies. From its inception, the United States government viewed subsidies as a necessary tool for advancing the public good. The first substantive act passed by Congress, on July 4, 1789, provided subsidies to various industries. For instance, section 4 of the act provided fishermen five cents for every barrel of pickled fish they exported. As the country grew, so did subsidies. By 1817, a new law decreed that any goods moved from one American port to another must be carried on U.S. ships, subsidizing certain shippers and increasing the transportation costs of farmers and merchants.</p>\n\n      <p>Today, subsidies remain an indispensable tool the federal government uses to redirect resources and influence economic decisions. From gasoline refineries to California wineries, there are hundreds of separate federal programs and tax provisions that provide some form of subsidy to businesses, individuals, non-profits and other organizations.</p>\n\n      <h3>Four Categories of Subsidy Programs</h3>\n\n      <p>In order to make the diversity of subsidies easier to understand, subsidies can be broken down into at least<sup><a hrtef=\"#footnote-2\">2</a></sup> the four following categories:</p>\n\n      <ol>\n      <li><strong>Direct Expenditures</strong>, including direct transfers of money, goods or services,\n      such as cash grants or the donation of government surplus. (This does not include\n      contracts for goods and services which are covered in a separate category below.)\n\n      <li><strong>Tax Expenditures</strong>, which lower the taxes certain parties pay the federal government by allowing special tax exemptions, deductions or credits.</li>\n\n      <li><strong>Risk Transfers</strong>, which convey financial risk to the federal government through insurance agreements, loans, loan guarantees and similar instruments.</li>\n\n      <li><strong>Government contracts</strong> for which the government pays more than fair market value for a good or service or provides a preference for certain types of businesses. For instance, the federal procurement system includes preferences for alternative fuel vehicles, and minority owned businesses.</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>Direct expenditures are probably the most recognizable category of subsidies. They include, for instance, government grant programs. Collecting data on direct expenditure programs is easy. However, measuring the subsidies delivered through direct expenditure programs can be quite hard. Not all of the money spent through direct expenditures is a subsidy, and measuring the subsidy requires economic data, such as market prices for public goods, that is often unavailable.</p>\n\n      <p>While direct expenditures increase government spending, tax expenditures result in a loss of federal revenue. Despite the difference, both methods increase the federal deficit and both give the recipient a benefit. Tax expenditures have increasingly grown in popularity because at least two important characteristics of the tax code favor it as a method of delivering subsidies. First, unlike many direct expenditures, tax expenditures do not have to be renewed through the budget process every year. Second, they appeal to politicians who may want to both confer benefits on a certain constituency and, at the same time, campaign on a platform of lower taxes.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"sidebar\">\n        <h3>Income vs. Consumption Tax Baseline</h3>\n        <p>Experts disagree on what baseline should be used to measure tax expenditures. Some believe that the current tax system is, or should be, a broad based income tax. Others argue it is, or should be, a consumption tax. The assumption can make a big difference in what gets counted as a tax expenditure. For instance, using an income tax baseline, the exemption for investment income from Individual Retirement Accounts would be considered a tax expenditure. Using the consumption tax baseline, it wouldn't.</p>\n        <p>Subsidyscope does not take a position on which tax structure is appropriate but adopts the income tax baseline for measuring tax expenditures. This is because the Department of the Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation currently use this baseline in making their estimates.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <p>These advantages have driven significant changes to the tax code to the extent that it is now riddled with tax credits, deductions, exemptions and other special provisions. For instance, between 1955 and 2005 the number of pages in the tax code quintupled from 409 to 2,139 with most of this increase occurring since 1985.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\">3</a></sup> Not surprisingly, the size of tax expenditures has also gone up. From 1974 through 2004 the sum of revenue lost due to all tax expenditures, adjusted for inflation, tripled from approximately $240 billion to nearly $730 billion.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\">4</a></sup> For individual taxpayers alone, the inflation-adjusted total went from $190 billion to $650 billion. The largest tax expenditures projected for 2010 are shown below.</p>\n\n      <p>The third category, risk transfers, may be the most difficult to understand and measure. When the federal government insures or provides credit, such as a loan guarantee, to an organization, there is not a direct transfer of money to the recipient. Instead, the recipient has conveyed financial risk to the government which may, or may not result in a cost to the government at a later date. The federal government has a difficult time measuring the cost of risk transfers and the estimates, assuming they are even done, can be highly contentious. For example, rival cost estimates for a recent proposal to substitute a student loan program for a student loan guarantee program differed by more than 40 percent ($33 billion).<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\">5</a></sup></p>\n\n      <p>While there is little information available on the subsidy provided through insurance programs, the gross amount of credit the federal government has provided through loans and loan guarantees has been steadily increasing over the last few decades. In the last two years it exploded. This is due not only to the federal bailout of financial institutions, but loans for housing, education and energy projects also boomed as private lending dried up and people and organizations turned to the government for credit.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"figure\">\n      <label>Figure 1</label>\n      <h3>Total Tax Expenditure Revenue Loss ($ Billions)</h3>\n      <img src=\"/media/images/framing_paper_figure_1.png\" alt=\"graph of individual and corporate tax expenditure revenue loss from 1975 to 2004\" /><br/>\n      <span class=\"source\"><strong>Source:</strong> GAO Analysis of OMB budget reports on tax expenditures, Fiscal Years 1976-2006.</span>\n      </div>\n\n      <p>The last category, government contracts, has long been used as a method for subsidizing certain activities the government encourages. For instance, in the 1840s the government wanted to support the development of oceangoing steamships, a relatively new technology at the time. This resulted in Congress offering padded Post Office contracts to shipping companies if they used steamships to deliver the mail. Today, contracts remain an explicit vehicle for delivering subsidies to preferable firms or activities. For example, federal procurement rules favor certain types of businesses, such as minority-owned businesses and certain types of goods, such as recycled paper.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"figure\">\n      <label>Figure 2</label>\n      <h3>Five Largest Tax Expenditures ($ Billions)</h3>\n      <h4>(ranked by total fiscal year 2010 projected revenue effect)</h4>\n      <table>\n        <tbody>\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n          <td>Exclusion of employer contributions for medical insurance premiums and medical care</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">155</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"even\">\n          <td>Deduction for mortgage interest on owner-occupied homes</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">108</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n          <td>Deductibility of income put in 401k Plans</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">53</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"even\">\n          <td>Deductibility of charitable contributions (other than education and health)</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">47</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n          <td>Deductibility of non-business State and local taxes (other than on owner-occupied homes)</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">30</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"even strong\">\n          <td>&nbsp;</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">Total 393</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"odd strong\">\n          <td>Percent of total tax Expenditures</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">41%</td>\n        </tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n\n      <span class=\"source\"><strong>Source:</strong> Office of Management and Budget, Analytical Perspectives, President's Fiscal Year 2010 Budget, p. 308.</span>\n      </div>\n\n      <p>Finally, a subsidy occurs under a contract when the government pays more than fair market value for a good or service. More often than not, a government contract is just a government contract and does not have a subsidy component. Unfortunately, it can sometimes be difficult to determine when a subsidy is taking place since the fair market value may be a matter of opinion. For example, as part of a trade dispute, the European Union claims Boeing, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, is receiving subsidies through \"overpriced [Department of Defense] contracts.\"<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\">6</a></sup> Boeing argues the \"payments represent the value of those services [rendered to the government.] They are not subsidies.\" It may be difficult to prove either side is correct.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n      <p>Subsidyscope does not attempt to determine which contracts have a subsidy component or measure what that component may be. We do presume, however, that competed contracts\u2014contracts that are subject to an open bidding process\u2014generally do not have a large subsidy component, even though the bidding process may include certain preferences. Thus, we focus on those contracts that are not competed and make this information available to the public. This does not mean non-competed contracts contain a significant subsidy, only that they are more likely to do so.</p>\n\n      <p>Whether through contracts or other means, subsidies are an indispensable tool for implementing public policy. That does not, however, mean all subsidy programs are necessary or successful. For instance, in 1971 the federal government guaranteed over $600 million in loans in a vain attempt to save Penn Central Railroad. Today, people have strong feelings about the need for all aspects of the recent financial bailout. Given changing and improved information, we must constantly ask whether our subsidy programs can be improved.</p>\n\n      <p>Government programs change all the time. Some, like housing subsidies, have been a topic of debate for decades. Regardless of whether a subsidy program is considered \"good\" or \"bad\", the creation, amendment or termination of such programs should be decided through the political process in an open, transparent and accountable manner based on solid research. Taxpayers and decision makers have a right to know where their money is being spent.</p>\n\n      <h3>Subsidies Run Deep...</h3>\n\n      <p>Many industries receive significant and continuing protection from foreign competition. Few Americans realize, for instance, they pay $1 more for a five pound bag of sugar<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\">8</a></sup> to subsidize domestic sugar beet and cane sugar farmers.</p>\n\n      <p>Subsidies, and spending on subsidy programs, can run deep, significantly affecting specific sectors of the economy. For instance, in FY 2007 through one tax provision alone, taxpayers subsidized health insurance coverage that companies provided to their employees by $133.8 billion.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\">9</a></sup> While a large amount of money, this was only part of over $874 billion the federal government spent on health care in 2007\u2014amounting to nearly half of all health care spending in the country (see table below).</p>\n\n      <h3>...and Wide</h3>\n\n      <p>Subsidies and spending on subsidy programs not only significantly influence particular economic sectors; they also cut a wide swath across the economy. Every major area of the economy is affected by federal subsidy programs.</p>\n\n      <p>Subsidyscope recently examined the amount of spending in six different sectors: agriculture, energy, transportation, health, housing and philanthropy. On average, federal spending accounts for 20 percent of all spending in these sectors (see table below).</p>\n\n      <div class=\"figure\">\n      <label>Figure 3</label>\n      <h3>2007 Total Federal Direct and Tax Expenditures as a Share of GDP, by Sector</h3>\n      <table>\n        <thead>\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n          <th>Economic Sector</th>\n          <th>Total Sector DGP ($ billions)</th>\n          <th>Percent of Sector GDP That Is Federal Expenditures (%)</th>\n        </tr>\n        </thead>\n\n        <tbody>\n        <tr class=\"even\">\n          <td>Energy</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">526</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">4.0</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n          <td>Transportation</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">1,496</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">5.2</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr class=\"even\">\n          <td>Housing</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">2,321</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">10.5</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n          <td>Agriculture</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">371</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">23.5</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr class=\"even\">\n          <td>Nonprofit</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">304</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">26.2</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n          <td>Health</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">2,009</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">43.5</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr class=\"even strong\">\n          <td>TOTAL FOR SIX SECTORS</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">$7,027</td>\n          <td class=\"numeric\">19.7%</td>\n        </tr>  \n\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n\n      <span class=\"source\"><strong>Sources include:</strong> BEA, 2007; Census of County Business Patterns 2006; IRS Statistics of Income 2006; OMB FY09 Budget 2008.</span>\n      </div>\n\n\n      <h3>Subsidies, the Budget and the Taxpayers' Right to Know</h3>\n\n      <p>Subsidies are a surprisingly large part of the federal budget. The amount of subsidies provided to all recipients in fiscal year 2007 through the tax code alone was comparable to the entire discretionary budget requested by President Bush: $844.2 billion<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\">10</a></sup> was spent through the tax code on both individuals and corporations,<sup><a href=\"#footnote-11\">11</a></sup> while $870.7 billion was requested in appropriations.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-12\">12</a></sup> Most of these tax breaks are subsidies.</p>\n\n      <p>Given the amount spent on subsidies, taxpayers have a right to know where these subsidies are going and in what amounts. Rarely has it been so important that the government act as a responsible steward for the public's resources. The Congressional Budget Office warns that, \"under current law, the federal budget is on an unsustainable path.\"<sup><a href=\"#footnote-13\">13</a></sup> The federal debt is projected to be 61 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2010,<sup><a href=\"#footnote-14\">14</a></sup> the highest level since shortly after World War II.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-15\">15</a></sup> A solution will require hard choices about who gets how much from government. A dollar spent subsidizing the housing industry cannot be spent on child health programs or reducing the debt, or any other priorities we may have as a nation. As we make these choices it will be necessary to carefully consider how much the federal government spends on which subsidy programs.</p>\n\n      <h3>Subsidies Are Hidden</h3>\n\n      <p>Unfortunately, most subsidy programs remain largely hidden. Often housed in euphemistically named offices or tucked away in subparts of complicated laws, many subsidies are so narrowly tailored that they are not typically known outside a particular sector or industry. For instance, very few people know that lead and zinc mining companies may deduct a \u2018depletion allowance' from their taxable income of up to 22 percent of their gross income (not to exceed 50 percent of their taxable income), which can add millions of dollars to their bottom line.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-16\">16</a></sup> The relative obscurity of many subsidies, despite their deep and broad reach into the economy, makes it difficult to weigh them against other government priorities.</p>\n\n      <p>Even when the presence of a subsidy is known, information regarding its scope and scale may be hard to find. Currently, information on many subsidy programs is scattered across the government. The Office of Management and Budget administers two large data sets at <a href=\"http://www.usaspending.gov\">USAspending.gov</a>, other information is published by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation and even more data is kept by the Department of the Treasury. However, even when found, this information can be unwieldy, unreliable and hard to understand. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.usaspending.gov\">USAspending.gov</a> contains procurement data on over 20 million government contracts. Unfortunately, many of the records are missing important information. Only half of the last decade's procurement records are assigned an industrial classification code providing important information on the source of the good or service. Worse, the system uses a privately owned system to identify contractors, which means the government cannot legally release any ownership data about the contractor associated with each record.</p>\n\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.usaspending.gov\">USAspending.gov</a> is also the primary source for information on grant and other assistance programs, but this data isn't much better than the information on contracts. The site relies on the Federal Assistance Award Data System (FAADS). Data in FAADS can be wildly inaccurate. For instance, Subsidyscope's own research indicates that more than half of the funding for Amtrak in fiscal year 2008 is missing and spending on the Merchant Marine Academy for the same year (over $60 million) is completely omitted.</p>\n\n      <p>Finally, the information on a subsidy may not be available in any database. For instance, as part of the recent bailout of financial institutions, the federal government received warrants and purchased preferred stock in a large number of banks. While Subsidyscope does, with effort, calculate the daily value of various federal warrants, it is currently impossible to obtain the value of all the preferred stock the federal government owns.</p>\n\n      <p>Over time, these obscure and hidden subsidy programs have accumulated like large rocks on a forest floor. Even if you can find them, it's hard to see what's going on underneath. However, given the extent and influence of subsidies on the U.S. economy, there is a fundamental need for a comprehensive and centralized source of subsidy information.\n\n      <h3>Turning Over the Rocks</h3>\n\n      <p>Federal subsidies serve many useful purposes. They can correct deficiencies in the marketplace. They can address problems of equity, provide public infrastructure and protect the environment. But they can also be inefficient, ineffective or expensive.</p>\n\n      <p>The public has a right to know how much subsidies cost and who is getting them. Further, confronted with a number of extremely difficult budgetary options, the government deserves good information to be in a better position to assess federal subsidy programs and make informed decisions about possible tradeoffs between government priorities.</p>\n\n      <p>Unfortunately, there is no one place to go to find out who is getting subsidies and how much they cost taxpayers. This information is difficult to find and, once found, hard to decipher. It is hidden... until now.</p>\n\n      <p>Pew's Subsidyscope project is building the most comprehensive searchable source for federal subsidy information to enable the public to better understand the government's spending priorities. Our project will provide objective facts to the public and decision makers and encourage an informed debate about how best to deploy scarce government resources.</p>\n\n      <p>As hard decisions are made, Subsidyscope will provide important information on subsidy programs. The project's data will stimulate a more vigorous debate and help the country make smarter choices. We are taking something that is hard to find and making it easy to get. We are turning over rocks and shining a light on what is underneath. Subsidyscope will help reveal our hidden budget.</p>\n\n\n\n\n      <ol id=\"footnotes\">\n\n      <li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>\"Rural Economic Development: More Assurance Is Needed That Grant Funding Information Is Accurately Reported.\" 2006.

Numbers provided are from the most recent estimate.</cite>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Impact</h4>\r\n<p>As a result of the special exclusion provided for parsonage allowances,\r\nministers receiving such housing allowances pay less tax than other\r\ntaxpayers with the same or smaller economic incomes. The tax benefit of the\r\nexclusion also provides a disproportionately greater benefit to relatively\r\nbetter-paid ministers, by virtue of the higher marginal tax rates applicable to\r\ntheir incomes.</p>\r\n<p>Further, some ministers claim income tax deductions for housing costs\r\nallocable to the receipt of tax-free allowances.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rationale</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The provision of tax-free housing allowances for ministers was first made\r\na part of the Internal Revenue Code by passage of the Revenue Act of 1921\r\n(P.L. 98 of the 67th Congress), without any stated reason. The original\r\nrationale may reflect the difficulty of placing a value on the provision of a\r\nchurch-provided rectory. Since some churches provided rectories to their\r\nministers as part of their compensation, while other churches provided a\r\nhousing allowance, Congress may have wished to provide equal tax\r\ntreatment to both groups. Another suggested rationale is that originally the\r\nprovision was provided in recognition of the clergy as an economically\r\ndeprived group with low incomes.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>The Internal Revenue Service reversed a 1962 ruling (Ruling 62-212) in\r\n1983 (Revenue Ruling 83-3) providing that, to the extent of the tax-free\r\nhousing allowance, deductions for interest and property taxes may not be\r\nitemized as a tax deduction. This change was based on the belief that it was\r\nunfair to allow tax-free income to be used to generate individual itemized\r\ndeductions to shelter taxable income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514), Congress reversed the IRS\r\nruling because the tax treatment had been long-standing, and some Members\r\nwere concerned that the IRS might treat tax-free housing allowances\r\nprovided to U.S. military personnel similarly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internal Revenue Service\u2019s position (Revenue Ruling 71-280) is that\r\nthe exclusion may not exceed the fair rental value of the home plus the cost\r\nof utilities. The Tax Court held that amounts used to provide a home are\r\nexcludable even if the amount received exceeds the fair market rental value\r\nof the home (Richard D. Warren, et ux. v. Commissioner; 114 T.C. No. 23\r\n(May 16, 2000)). In that case, 100 percent of compensation was designated\r\nas a housing allowance ($77,663 in 1993, $76,309 in 1994, and $84,278 in\r\n1995). The court dismissed the IRS\u2019s argument that its position prevents\r\nunequal treatment between ministers for whom housing is provided and\r\nexcluded and those ministers receiving a rental allowance. That decision\r\nwas appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which directed parties\r\nto submit briefs on whether the court should address the constitutionality of\r\nthe parsonage exclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to forestall action by the Ninth Circuit by making the underlying\r\nissue in the Warren case moot, Congress clarified the parsonage housing tax\r\nallowance with passage of the Clergy Housing Allowance Clarification Act\r\nof 2002 (P.L. 107-181). In large part Congress adopted the more\r\nconservative IRS position such that the \u201callowance does not exceed the fair\r\nrental value of the home, including furnishings and appurtenances such as a\r\ngarage, plus the cost of utilities.\u201d The Act says that it is intended to\r\n\u201cminimize government intrusion into internal church operations and the\r\nrelationship between a church and its clergy\u201d and \u201crecognize that clergy\r\nfrequently are required to use their homes for purposes that would otherwise\r\nqualify for favorable tax treatment, but which may require more intrusive\r\ninquiries by the government into the relationship between clergy and their\r\nrespective churches with respect to activities that are inherently religious.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\n<p>The tax-free parsonage allowances encourage some congregations to\r\nstructure maximum amounts of tax-free housing allowances into their\r\nminister\u2019s pay and may thereby distort the compensation package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provision is inconsistent with economic principles of horizontal and\r\nvertical equity. Since all taxpayers may not exclude amounts they pay for\r\nhousing from taxable income, the provision violates horizontal equity\r\nprinciples. For example, a clergyman teaching in an affiliated religious\r\nschool may exclude the value of his housing allowance whereas a teacher in\r\nthe same school may not. This example shows how the tax law provides\r\ndifferent tax treatment to two taxpayers whose economic incomes may be\r\nsimilar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ministers with higher incomes receive a greater tax subsidy than lower-\r\nincome ministers because of their higher marginal tax rates. Vertical equity\r\nis a concept which requires that tax burdens be distributed fairly among\r\npeople with different abilities to pay. The disproportionate benefit of the tax\r\nexclusion to individuals with higher incomes reduces the progressivity of the\r\ntax system, which is viewed as a reduction in equity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ministers who have church-provided homes do not receive the same tax\r\nbenefits as those who purchase their homes and also have the tax deductions\r\nfor interest and property taxes available to them. Code Section 265\r\ndisallows deductions for interest and expenses which relate to tax-exempt\r\nincome except in the case of military housing allowances and the parsonage\r\nallowance. As such, this result is inconsistent with the general tax policy\r\nprinciple of preventing double tax benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Selected Bibliography</h4>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc !important;\">\r\n   <li>Anthony, Murray S. and Kent N.

For contributions to non-operating foundations and\r\norganizations, deductibility is limited to the lesser of 30 percent of the\r\ntaxpayer\u2019s contribution base, or the excess of 50 percent of the contribution\r\nbase for the tax year over the amount of contributions which qualified for the\r\n50 percent deduction ceiling (including carryovers from previous years).\r\nGifts of capital gain property to these organizations are limited to 20 percent\r\nof AGI.</p>\r\n           \r\n<p>If a contribution is made in the form of property, the deduction depends\r\non the type of taxpayer (i.e., individual, corporate, etc.), recipient, and\r\npurpose.</p>                                 \r\n\r\n<p>The maximum amount deductible by a corporation is 10 percent of its\r\nadjusted taxable income. Adjusted taxable income is defined to mean\r\ntaxable income with regard to the charitable contribution deduction,\r\ndividends-received deduction, any net operating loss carryback, and any\r\ncapital loss carryback. Excess contributions may be carried forward for five\r\nyears. Amounts carried forward are used on a first-in, first-out basis after the\r\ndeduction for the current year\u2019s charitable gifts have been taken. Typically,\r\na deduction is allowed only in the year in which the contribution occurs.\r\nHowever, an accrual-basis corporation is allowed to claim a deduction in the\r\nyear preceding payment if its board of directors authorizes a charitable gift\r\nduring the year and payment is scheduled by the 15th day of the third month\r\nof the next tax year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,\r\nP.L. 108-357, donors of noncash charitable contributions face increased\r\nreporting requirements. For charitable donations of property valued at\r\n$5,000 or more, donors must obtain a qualified appraisal of the donated\r\nproperty. For donated property valued in excess of $500,000, the appraisal\r\nmust be attached to the donor\u2019s tax return. Deductions for donations of\r\npatents and other intellectual property are limited to the lesser of the\r\ntaxpayer\u2019s basis in the donated property or the property\u2019s fair market value.\r\nTaxpayers can claim additional deductions in years following the donation\r\nbased on the income the donated property provides to the donee. The 2004\r\nact also mandates additional reporting requirements for charitable\r\norganizations receiving vehicle donations from individuals claiming a tax\r\ndeduction for the contribution, if it is valued in excess of $500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taxpayers are required to obtain written substantiation from a donee\r\norganization for contributions which exceed $250. This substantiation must\r\nbe received no later than the date the donor-taxpayer filed the required\r\nincome tax return. Donee organizations are obligated to furnish the written\r\nacknowledgment when requested with sufficient information to substantiate\r\nthe taxpayer\u2019s deductible contribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-280) included several\r\nprovisions that temporarily expand charitable giving incentives. The\r\nprovisions, effective after December 31, 2005 and before January 1, 2008,\r\ninclude enhancements to laws governing non-cash gifts and tax-free\r\ndistributions from individual retirement plans for charitable purposes. The\r\n2006 law also tightened rules governing charitable giving in certain areas,\r\nincluding gifts of taxidermy, contributions of clothing and household items,\r\ncontributions of fractional interests in tangible personal property, and record-\r\nkeeping and substantiation requirements for certain charitable contributions.\r\nTemporary charitable giving incentives were further extended by the\r\nEconomic Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343)\r\nenacted in October 2008.</p>\r\n                            \r\n<p>The deduction for charitable contributions reduces the net cost of\r\ncontributing. In effect, the Federal Government provides the donor with a\r\ncorresponding grant that increases in value with the donor\u2019s marginal tax\r\nbracket. Those individuals who use the standard deduction or who pay no\r\ntaxes receive no benefit from the provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A limitation applies to the itemized deductions of high-income taxpayers.\r\nUnder this provision, initially a phaseout applied which reduced itemized\r\ndeductions by 3 percent of the amount by which a taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross\r\nincome (AGI) exceeds an inflation adjusted dollar amount ($166,800 in\r\n2009). This phase out is, in turn being phased out, and in 2009 is reduced by\r\ntwo thirds. It is eliminated in 2010, but after that year the elimination of the\r\nphaseout expires, unless extended.

Senator Hollis, the sponsor, argued that high wartime tax rates\r\nwould absorb the surplus funds of wealthy taxpayers, which were generally\r\ncontributed to charitable organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provisions enacted in 2004 resulted from Internal Revenue Service\r\nand congressional concerns that taxpayers were claiming inflated charitable\r\ndeductions, causing the loss of federal revenue. In the case of vehicle\r\ndonations, concern was expressed about the inflation of deductions. GAO\r\nreports published in 2003 indicated that the value of benefit to charitable\r\norganizations from donated vehicles was significantly less than the value\r\nclaimed as deductions by taxpayers. The 2006 enactments were, in part, a\r\nresult of continued concerns from 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\n<p>Supporters note that contributions finance socially desirable activities.\r\nFurther, the federal government would be forced to step in to assume some\r\nactivities currently provided by charitable, nonprofit organizations if the\r\ndeduction were eliminated. However, public spending might not be\r\navailable to make up all of the difference. In addition, many believe that the\r\nbest method of allocating general welfare resources is through a dual system\r\nof private philanthropic giving and governmental allocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists have generally held that the deductibility of charitable\r\ncontributions provides an incentive effect which varies with the marginal tax\r\nrate of the giver. There are a number of studies which find significant\r\nbehavioral responses, although a study by Randolph suggests that such\r\nmeasured responses may largely reflect transitory timing effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Types of contributions may vary substantially among income classes.\r\nContributions to religious organizations are far more concentrated at the\r\nlower end of the income scale than contributions to hospitals, the arts, and\r\neducational institutions, with contributions to other types of organizations\r\nfalling between these levels. However, the volume of donations to religious\r\norganizations is greater than to all other organizations as a group. For\r\nexample, the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel Trust for\r\nPhilanthropy, Inc. estimated that giving to religious institutions amounted to\r\n45 percent of all contributions ($93.2 billion) in calendar year 2005. This\r\nwas in comparison to the next largest component of charitable giving\r\nrecipients, educational institutions, at 14.8 percent ($38.56 billion).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who support eliminating this deduction note that deductible\r\ncontributions are made partly with dollars which are public funds. They feel\r\nthat helping out private charities may not be the optimal way to spend\r\ngovernment money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opponents further claim that the present system allows wealthy taxpayers\r\nto indulge special interests and hobbies. To the extent that charitable giving\r\nis independent of tax considerations, federal revenues are lost without having\r\nprovided any additional incentive for charitable gifts. It is generally argued\r\nthat the charitable contributions deduction is difficult to administer and adds\r\ncomplexity to the tax code.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Selected Bibliography</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc !important;\">\r\n   <li>Aprill, Ellen P. \u201cChurches, Politics, and the Charitable Contribution\r\nDeduction,\u201d Boston College Law Review, v. 42 (July 2001), pp. 843-873.</li>\r\n   <li>Boatsman, James R. and Sanjay Gupta. \u201cTaxes and Corporate Charity:\r\nEmpirical Evidence From Micro-Level Panel Data,\u201d National Tax Journal,\r\nv. 49 (June 1996), pp. 193-213.</li>\r\n   <li>Broman, Amy J. \u201cStatutory Tax Rate Reform and Charitable\r\nContributions: Evidence from a Recent Period of Reform,\u201d Journal of the\r\nAmerican Taxation Association.

For contributions to nonoperating foundations\r\nand organizations, deductibility is limited to the lesser of 30 percent of the\r\ntaxpayer\u2019s contribution base, or the excess of 50 percent of the contribution\r\nbase for the tax year over the amount of contributions which qualified for the\r\n50-percent deduction ceiling (including carryovers from previous years).\r\nGifts of capital gain property to these organizations are limited to 20 percent\r\nof AGI.</p>\r\n          \r\n<p>The maximum amount deductible by a corporation is 10 percent of its\r\nadjusted taxable income. Adjusted taxable income is defined to mean\r\ntaxable income with regard to the charitable contribution deduction,\r\ndividends-received deduction, any net operating loss carryback, and any\r\ncapital loss carryback. Excess contributions may be carried forward for five\r\nyears. Amounts carried forward are used on a first-in, first-out basis after the\r\ndeduction for the current year\u2019s charitable gifts have been taken. Typically,\r\na deduction is allowed only in the year in which the contribution occurs.\r\nHowever, an accrual-basis corporation is allowed to claim a deduction in the\r\nyear preceding payment if its board of directors authorizes a charitable gift\r\nduring the year and payment is scheduled by the 15th day of the third month\r\nof the next tax year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a contribution is made in the form of property, the deduction depends\r\non the type of taxpayer (i.e., individual, corporate, etc.), recipient, and\r\npurpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,\r\nP.L. 108-357, donors of noncash charitable contributions face increased\r\nreporting requirements. For charitable donations of property valued at\r\n$5,000 or more, donors must obtain a qualified appraisal of the donated\r\nproperty. For donated property valued in excess of $500,000, the appraisal\r\nmust be attached to the donor\u2019s tax return. Deductions for donations of\r\npatents and other intellectual property are limited to the lesser of the\r\ntaxpayer\u2019s basis in the donated property or the property\u2019s fair market value.\r\nTaxpayers can claim additional deductions in years following the donation\r\nbased on the income the donated property provides to the donee. The 2004\r\nact also mandated additional reporting requirements for charitable\r\norganizations receiving vehicle donations from individuals claiming a tax\r\ndeduction for the contribution, if it is valued in excess of $500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taxpayers are required to obtain written substantiation from a donee\r\norganization for contributions which exceed $250. This substantiation must\r\nbe received no later than the date the donor-taxpayer files the required\r\nincome tax return. Donee organizations are obligated to furnish the written\r\nacknowledgment when requested with sufficient information to substantiate\r\nthe taxpayer\u2019s deductible contribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-280) included several\r\nprovisions that temporarily expand charitable giving incentives. The\r\nprovisions, effective after December 31, 2005 and before January 1, 2008,\r\ninclude enhancements to laws governing non-cash gifts and tax-free\r\ndistributions from individual retirement plans for charitable purposes. The\r\n2006 law also tightened rules governing charitable giving in certain areas,\r\nincluding gifts of taxidermy, contributions of clothing and household items,\r\ncontributions of fractional interests in tangible personal property, and record-\r\nkeeping and substantiation requirements for certain charitable contributions.\r\nTemporary charitable giving incentives were further extended by the\r\nEconomic Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343)\r\nenacted in October 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Impact</h4>\r\n<p>The deduction for charitable contributions reduces the net cost of\r\ncontributing. In effect, the federal government provides the donor with a\r\ncorresponding grant that increases in value with the donor\u2019s marginal tax\r\nbracket. Those individuals who use the standard deduction or who pay no\r\ntaxes receive no benefit from the provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A limitation applies to the itemized deductions of high-income taxpayers.\r\nUnder this provision, initially a phaseout applied which reduced itemized\r\ndeductions by 3 percent of the amount by which a taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross\r\nincome (AGI) exceeds an inflation adjusted dollar amount ($166,800 in\r\n2009).

Senator Hollis, the sponsor, argued that high wartime tax rates\r\nwould absorb the surplus funds of wealthy taxpayers, which were generally\r\ncontributed to charitable organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provisions enacted in 2004 resulted from Internal Revenue Service\r\nand congressional concerns that taxpayers were claiming inflated charitable\r\ndeductions, causing the loss of federal revenue. In the case of vehicle\r\ndonations, concern was expressed about the inflation of deductions. GAO\r\nreports published in 2003 indicated that the value of benefit to charitable\r\norganizations from donated vehicles was significantly less than the value\r\nclaimed as deductions by taxpayers. The 2006 enactments were, in part, a\r\nresult of continued concerns from 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporters note that contributions finance desirable activities such as\r\nhospital care for the poor. Further, the Federal Government would be forced\r\nto step in to assume some of the activities currently provided by health care\r\norganizations if the deduction were eliminated; however, public spending\r\nmight not be available to make up all of the difference. In addition, many\r\nbelieve that the best method of allocating general welfare resources is\r\nthrough a dual system of private philanthropic giving and governmental\r\nallocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists have generally held that the deductibility of charitable\r\ncontributions provides an incentive effect which varies with the marginal tax\r\nrate of the giver. There are a number of studies which find significant\r\nbehavioral responses, although a study by Randolph suggests that such\r\nmeasured responses may largely reflect transitory timing effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Types of contributions may vary substantially among income classes.\r\nContributions to religious organizations are far more concentrated at the\r\nlower end of the income scale than are contributions to health organizations,\r\nthe arts, and educational institutions, with contributions to other types of\r\norganizations falling between these levels. However, the volume of\r\ndonations to religious organizations is greater than to all other organizations\r\nas a group. In 2005, the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel\r\nTrust for Philanthropy, Inc. (AAFRC) estimated that contributions to\r\nreligious institutions amounted to 45 percent of all contributions ($93.2\r\nbillion), while contributions to health care providers and associations\r\namounted to less than 21 percent ($22.5 billion).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using current dollars, AAFRC reported giving to health increased by 4.8\r\npercent in 2000, declined in 2001 and 2002, rose by 8.2 percent in 2003, 5.1\r\npercent in 2004, and 2.7 percent in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been a debate concerning the amount of charity care being\r\nprovided by health care organizations with tax-exempt status. In the 109th\r\nCongress, hearings were held by both the Senate Committee on Finance and\r\nthe House Committee on Ways and Means to examine the charitable status\r\nof nonprofit health care organizations. Those who support eliminating\r\ncharitable deductions note that deductible contributions are made partly with\r\ndollars which are public funds. They feel that helping out private charities\r\nmay not be the optimal way to spend government money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opponents further claim that the present system allows wealthy taxpayers\r\nto indulge special interests and hobbies. To the extent that charitable giving\r\nis independent of tax considerations, federal revenues are lost without having\r\nprovided any additional incentive for charitable gifts. It is generally argued\r\nthat the charitable contributions deduction is difficult to administer and that\r\ntaxpayers have difficulty complying with it because of complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Selected Bibliography</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc !important;\">\r\n   <li>Aprill, Ellen P. \u201cChurches, Politics, and the Charitable Contribution\r\nDeduction,\u201d Boston College Law Review, v. 42 (July 2001), pp. 843-873.</li>\r\n   <li>Bennett, James T. and Thomas J.

For contributions to nonoperating foundations\r\nand organizations, deductibility is limited to the lesser of 30 percent of the\r\ntaxpayer\u2019s contribution base, or the excess of 50 percent of the contribution\r\nbase for the tax year over the amount of contributions which qualified for the\r\n50-percent deduction ceiling (including carryovers from previous years). \r\nGifts of capital gain property to these organizations are limited to 20 percent\r\nof AGI.</p>\r\n                                     \r\n<p>The maximum amount deductible by a corporation is 10 percent of its\r\nadjusted taxable income. Adjusted taxable income is defined to mean\r\ntaxable income with regard to the charitable contribution deduction,\r\ndividends-received deduction, any net operating loss carryback, and any\r\ncapital loss carryback. Excess contributions may be carried forward for five\r\nyears. Amounts carried forward are used on a first-in, first-out basis after the\r\ndeduction for the current year\u2019s charitable gifts have been taken. Typically,\r\na deduction is allowed only in the year in which the contribution occurs.\r\nHowever, an accrual-basis corporation is allowed to claim a deduction in the\r\nyear preceding payment if its board of directors authorizes a charitable gift\r\nduring the year and payment is scheduled by the 15th day of the third month\r\nof the next tax year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a contribution is made in the form of property, the deduction depends\r\non the type of taxpayer (i.e., individual, corporate, etc.), recipient, and\r\npurpose.</p>\r\n   \r\n<p>As a result of the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,\r\nP.L. 108-357, donors of noncash charitable contributions face increased\r\nreporting requirements. For charitable donations of property valued at\r\n$5,000 or more, donors must obtain a qualified appraisal of the donated\r\nproperty. For donated property valued in excess of $500,000, the appraisal\r\nmust be attached to the donor\u2019s tax return. Deductions for donations of\r\npatents and other intellectual property are limited to the lesser of the\r\ntaxpayer\u2019s basis in the donated property or the property\u2019s fair market value.\r\nTaxpayers can claim additional deductions in years following the donation\r\nbased on the income the donated property provides to the donee. The 2004\r\nact also mandated additional reporting requirements for charitable\r\norganizations receiving vehicle donations from individuals claiming a tax\r\ndeduction for the contribution, if it is valued in excess of $500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taxpayers are required to obtain written substantiation from a donee\r\norganization for contributions that exceed $250. This substantiation must be\r\nreceived no later than the date the donor-taxpayer files the required income\r\ntax return. Donee organizations are obligated to furnish the written\r\nacknowledgment when requested with sufficient information to substantiate\r\nthe taxpayer\u2019s deductible contribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-280) included several\r\nprovisions that temporarily expand charitable giving incentives. The\r\nprovisions, effective after December 31, 2005 and before January 1, 2008,\r\ninclude enhancements to laws governing non-cash gifts and tax-free\r\ndistributions from individual retirement plans for charitable purposes. The\r\n2006 law also tightened rules governing charitable giving in certain areas,\r\nincluding gifts of taxidermy, contributions of clothing and household items,\r\ncontributions of fractional interests in tangible personal property, and record-\r\nkeeping and substantiation requirements for certain charitable contributions.\r\nTemporary charitable giving incentives were further extended by the\r\nEconomic Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343)\r\nenacted in October 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Impact</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The deduction for charitable contributions reduces the net cost of\r\ncontributing. In effect, the federal government provides the donor with a\r\ncorresponding grant that increases in value with the donor\u2019s marginal tax\r\nbracket. Those individuals who use the standard deduction or who pay no\r\ntaxes receive no benefit from the provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A limitation applies to the itemized deductions of high-income taxpayers.\r\nUnder this provision, initially a phaseout applied which reduced itemized\r\ndeductions by 3 percent of the amount by which a taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross\r\nincome (AGI) exceeds an inflation adjusted dollar amount ($166,800 in\r\n2009). This phase out is, in turn being phased out, and in 2009 is reduced by\r\ntwo thirds. It is eliminated in 2010, but after that year the elimination of the\r\nphaseout expires, unless extended.

Senator Hollis, the sponsor, argued that high wartime tax rates\r\nwould absorb the surplus funds of wealthy taxpayers, which were generally\r\ncontributed to charitable organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was also argued that many colleges would lose students to the military\r\nand charitable gifts were needed by educational institutions. Thus, the\r\noriginal rationale shows a concern for educational organizations. The\r\ndeduction was extended to estates and trusts in 1918 and to corporations in\r\n1935.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provisions enacted in 2004 resulted from Internal Revenue Service\r\nand congressional concerns that taxpayers were claiming inflated charitable\r\ndeductions, causing significant federal revenue loss. In the case of patent\r\nand other intellectual property donations, the IRS expressed concern not only\r\nabout overvaluation of property, but also whether consideration was received\r\nin return for the donation and whether only a partial interest, rather than full\r\ninterest, of property was being transferred. The 2006 enactments were, in\r\npart, a result of continued concerns from 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\n<p>Most economists agree that education produces substantial \u201cspillover\u201d\r\neffects benefitting society in general. Examples include a more efficient\r\nworkforce, lower unemployment rates, lower welfare costs, and less crime.\r\nAn educated electorate fosters a more responsive and effective government.\r\nSince these benefits accrue to society at large, they argue in favor of the\r\ngovernment actively promoting education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, proponents argue that the Federal government would be forced\r\nto assume some activities now provided by educational organizations if the\r\ndeduction were eliminated. However, public spending might not be\r\navailable to make up all the difference. Also, many believe that the best\r\nmethod of allocating general welfare resources is through a dual system of\r\nprivate philanthropic giving and governmental allocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists have generally held that the deductibility of charitable\r\ncontributions provides an incentive effect which varies with the marginal tax\r\nrate of the giver. There are a number of studies which find significant\r\nbehavioral responses, although a study by Randolph suggests that such\r\nmeasured responses may largely reflect transitory timing effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Types of contributions may vary substantially among income classes. For\r\nexample, contributions to religious organizations are far more concentrated\r\nat the lower end of the income scale than contributions to educational\r\ninstitutions. More highly valued contributions, like intellectual property and\r\npatents, tend to be made by corporations to educational institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been estimated by the American Association of Fund-Raising\r\nCounsel Trust for Philanthropy, Inc. that giving to public and private\r\ncolleges, universities, elementary schools, secondary schools, libraries, and\r\nto special scholarship funds, nonprofit trade schools, and other educational\r\nfacilities amounted to $38.56 billion in calendar year 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opponents say that helping educational organizations may not be the best\r\nway to spend government money. Opponents further claim that the present\r\nsystem allows wealthy taxpayers to indulge special interests (such as gifts to\r\ntheir alma mater).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the extent that charitable giving is independent of tax considerations,\r\nfederal revenues are lost without any corresponding increase in charitable\r\ngifts. It is generally argued that the charitable contributions deduction is\r\ndifficult to administer and adds complexity to the tax code.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Selected Bibliography</h4>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc !important;\">\r\n  <li>Aprill, Ellen P. \u201cChurches, Politics, and the Charitable Contribution\r\nDeduction,\u201d Boston College Law Review, v. 42 (July 2001), pp. 843-873.</li>\r\n  <li>Arnone, Michael. \u201cCongress Approves Lower Tax Benefits for Donations\r\nof Intellectual Property,\u201d Chronicle of Higher Education, v. 51, iss. 9,\r\nOctober 22, 2004, p.

If this exemption were repealed, both federally chartered and\r\nState chartered credit unions would become liable for payment of Federal\r\ncorporate income taxes on their retained earnings but not on earnings\r\ndistributed to depositors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a given addition to retained earnings, this tax exemption permits\r\ncredit unions to pay members higher dividends and charge members lower\r\ninterest rates on loans. Over the past 25 years, this tax exemption may have\r\ncontributed to the more rapid growth of credit unions compared to other\r\ndepository institutions.</p>\r\n   \r\n<p>Opponents of credit union taxation emphasize that credit unions provide\r\nmany services free or below cost in order to assist low-income members.\r\nThese services include small loans, financial counseling, and low-balance\r\nshare drafts. They argue that the taxation of credit unions would create\r\npressure to eliminate these subsidized services. But whether or not consumer\r\naccess to basic depository services is a significant problem is disputed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rationale</h4>\r\n<p>Credit unions have never been subject to the Federal income tax.\r\nInitially, they were included in the provision that exempted domestic\r\nbuilding and loan associations \u2014 whose business was at one time confined\r\nto lending to members \u2014 and nonprofit cooperative banks operated for\r\nmutual purposes. The exemption for mutual banks and savings and loan\r\ninstitutions was removed in 1951, but credit unions retained their exemption.\r\nNo specific reason was given for continuing the exemption of credit unions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1978, the Carter Administration proposed that the taxation of credit\r\nunions be phased in over a five-year period. In 1984, a report of the\r\nDepartment of the Treasury to the President proposed that the tax exemption\r\nof credit unions be repealed. In 1985, the Reagan Administration proposed\r\nthe taxation of credit unions with over $5 million in gross assets. In the\r\nbudget for fiscal year 1993, the Bush Administration proposed that the tax\r\nexemption for credit unions with assets in excess of $50 million be repealed.\r\nOn March 16, 2004, Donald E. Powell, Chairman of the Federal Deposit\r\nInsurance Corporation, stated that \u201ccredit unions ought to pay taxes.\u201d On\r\nNovember 3, 2005, the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing\r\non \u201cReview of Credit Union Tax Exemption.\u201d In the first session of the\r\n110th Congress, the U.S. Treasury published two major studies concerning\r\ncorporate tax reform: \u201cBusiness Taxation and the Global Competitiveness,\u201d\r\nand \u201cApproaches to Improve the Competitiveness of the U.S. Business Tax\r\nSystem for the 21st Century.\u201d Both of these studies recommended\r\nbroadening the corporate tax base by repealing various business tax breaks\r\nincluding the tax exempt status of credit unions. Officials of the credit union\r\nindustry argued that these Treasury reports were in conflict with a 2004 letter\r\nfrom President Bush stating his support for the credit union tax exemption.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\n<p>Supporters of the credit union exemption emphasize the uniqueness of\r\ncredit unions compared to other depository institutions. Credit unions are\r\nnonprofit financial cooperatives organized by people with a common bond,\r\nwhich is a unifying characteristic among members that distinguishes them\r\nfrom the general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit unions are directed by volunteers for the purpose of serving their\r\nmembers. Consequently, the exemption\u2019s supporters maintain that credit\r\nunions are member-driven while other depository institutions are profit-\r\ndriven. Furthermore, supporters argue that credit unions are subject to\r\ncertain regulatory constraints not required of other depository institutions\r\nand that these constraints reduce the competitiveness of credit unions. For\r\nexample, credit unions may only accept deposits of members and lend only\r\nto members, other credit unions, or credit union organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proponents of taxation argue that deregulation has caused extensive\r\ncompetition among all depository institutions, including credit unions, and\r\nthat the tax exemption gives credit unions an unwarranted advantage.\r\nProponents of taxation argue that depository institutions should have a level\r\nplaying field in order for market forces to allocate resources efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Selected Bibliography</h4>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc !important;\">\r\n  <li>Bickley, James M.

These nonprofit organization bonds are classified as\r\nprivate-activity bonds rather than governmental bonds because a substantial\r\nportion of their benefits accrues to individuals or business rather than to the\r\ngeneral public.

Numbers provided are from the most recent estimate.</cite>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Impact</h4>\r\n<p>Since interest on the bonds is tax exempt, purchasers are willing to accept\r\nlower before-tax rates of interest than on taxable securities. These low\r\ninterest rates enable issuers to finance educational facilities at reduced\r\ninterest rates. Some of the benefits of the tax exemption also flow to bond-\r\nholders. For a discussion of the factors that determine the shares of benefits\r\ngoing to bondholders and users of the nonprofit educational facilities, and\r\nestimates of the distribution of tax-exempt interest income by income class,\r\nsee the \u201cImpact\u201d discussion under General Purpose Public Assistance:\r\nExclusion of Interest on Public Purpose State and Local Debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rationale</h4>\r\n<p>An early decision of the U.S. Supreme Court predating the enactment of\r\nthe first Federal income tax, Dartmouth College v. Woodward (17 U.S. 518\r\n[1819]), confirmed the legality of government support for charitable\r\norganizations that provided services to the public. The income tax adopted\r\nin 1913, in conformance with this principle, exempted from taxation virtually\r\nthe same organizations now included under Section 501(c)(3). In addition\r\nto their tax-exempt status, these institutions were permitted to receive the\r\nbenefits of tax-exempt bonds under The Revenue and Expenditure Control\r\nAct of 1968. Almost all States have established public authorities to issue\r\ntax-exempt bonds for nonprofit educational facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interest exclusion for qualified public educational facilities was\r\nprovided for in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of\r\n2001 and is intended to extend tax preferences to public school facilities\r\nwhich are owned by private, for-profit corporations. The school must have,\r\nhowever, a public-private agreement with the local education authority. The\r\nprivate-activity bond status of these bonds subjects them to more severe\r\nrestrictions in some areas, such as arbitrage rebate and advance refunding,\r\nthan would apply if they were classified as traditional governmental school\r\nbonds.</p>\r\n         \r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Efforts have been made to reclassify nonprofit bonds as governmental\r\nbonds. Central to this issue is the extent to which nonprofit organizations are\r\nfulfilling their public purpose. Some argue that these entities are using their\r\ntax-exempt status to subsidize goods and services for groups that might\r\nreceive more critical scrutiny if they were subsidized by direct federal\r\nexpenditure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one of many categories of tax-exempt private-activity bonds, nonprofit\r\neducational facilities and public education bonds have increased the\r\nfinancing costs of bonds issued for more traditional public capital stock. In\r\naddition, this class of tax-exempt bonds has increased the supply of assets\r\nthat individuals and corporations can use to shelter income from taxation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Selected Bibliography</h4>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc !important;\">\r\n   <li>Maguire, Steven.

First, eligible health insurers are treated in the tax law as stock\r\nproperty and casualty insurance companies. Eligible organizations, however,\r\ncan fully deduct unearned premiums, unlike other property and casualty\r\ninsurance companies. Second, eligible companies may take a special\r\ndeduction of 25 percent of the year\u2019s health-related claims and expenses\r\nminus its accumulated surplus at the beginning of the year (if such claims\r\nand expenses exceed the accumulated surplus). For example, if an eligible\r\nhealth insurer had claims and related expenses of $150 million and an\r\naccumulated surplus of $110 million during a tax year, it could take a special\r\ndeduction of $10 million (i.e., 25 percent of the difference between $150\r\nmillion and $110 million). The special deduction is also known as the\r\n\u201cthree-month\u201d deduction because when an eligible insurer\u2019s health-related\r\nclaims and expenses exceed its accumulated surplus, it may deduct a quarter\r\nof the difference for the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The special deduction only applies to net taxable income for the year and\r\ncannot be used in alternative minimum tax calculations. Therefore, net\r\nincome for eligible organizations is subject to a minimum tax rate of 20\r\npercent.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\">\r\n<h5 style=\"margin-top:20px;\">Tax Expenditure by fiscal year ($ millions)</h5>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"header-row\"><td></td>\r\n<td>1998</td>\r\n<td>1999</td>\r\n<td>2000</td>\r\n<td>2001</td>\r\n<td>2002</td>\r\n<td>2003</td>\r\n<td>2004</td>\r\n<td>2005</td>\r\n<td>2006</td>\r\n<td>2007</td>\r\n<td>2008</td>\r\n<td>2009</td>\r\n<td>2010</td>\r\n<td>2011</td>\r\n<td>2012</td>\r\n<td>2013</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Corporations</td>\r\n<td>$210</td>\r\n<td>$245</td>\r\n<td>$230</td>\r\n<td>$270</td>\r\n<td>$300</td>\r\n<td>$350</td>\r\n<td>$400</td>\r\n<td>$710</td>\r\n<td>$620</td>\r\n<td>$620</td>\r\n<td>$640</td>\r\n<td>$650</td>\r\n<td>$660</td>\r\n<td>$670</td>\r\n<td>$680</td>\r\n<td>$680</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Individuals</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n<td>$0</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<cite>Source: Analytical Perspectives, President\u2019s Fiscal Year Budget, 2007-2010. Numbers provided are from the most recent estimate.</cite>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Impact</h4>\r\n<p>BlueCross BlueShield organizations traditionally provided community-\r\nrated health insurance. The special deduction for BlueCross BlueShield\r\nplans may help offset costs of providing high-risk and small-group coverage.\r\nThe BlueCross BlueShield organizations are not owned by investors, so the\r\nspecial deduction could also benefit either their subscribers or all health\r\ninsurance purchasers (through reduced premiums), their managers and\r\nemployees (through increased compensation), or affiliated hospitals and\r\nphysicians (through increased fees).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rationale</h4>\r\n<p>The \u201cBlues\u201d had been ruled tax-exempt by Internal Revenue regulations\r\nsince their inception in the 1930s, apparently because they were regarded as\r\ncommunity service organizations. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 removed\r\nBlueCross BlueShield plans\u2019 tax exemption because Congress believed that\r\n\u201cexempt charitable and social welfare organizations that engage in insurance\r\nactivities are engaged in an activity whose nature and scope is inherently\r\ncommercial rather than charitable,\u201d and that \u201cthe tax-exempt status of\r\norganizations engaged in insurance activities provided an unfair competitive\r\nadvantage.\u201d The 1986 Act, however, introduced the special deduction\r\ndescribed above, in part because of their continuing, albeit more limited, role\r\nin providing community-rated health insurance. In particular, Section\r\n833(c)2(c) links the special deduction for BlueCross BlueShield plans to\r\nthe provision of high-risk and small-group coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\n<p>Differences in price and coverage between the health insurance products\r\noffered by BlueCross and BlueShield plans and those offered by\r\ncommercial insurers, in the view of Congress, have faded over time. Some\r\nof the plans have accumulated enough surplus to purchase unrelated\r\nbusinesses. Many receive a substantial part of their income from\r\nadministering Medicare or self-insurance plans of other companies. Some\r\nhave argued that these tax preferences have benefitted their managers and\r\ntheir affiliated hospitals and physicians more than their communities.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>BlueCross and BlueShield organizations, however, retain a commitment\r\nto offer high-risk and small-group insurance coverage in their charters.\r\nSome continue to offer policies with premiums based on community payout\r\nexperience (\u201ccommunity rated\u201d). The tax exemption previously granted to\r\nthe \u201cBlues,\u201d as well as the current special deduction, presumably have helped\r\nsupport these community-oriented activities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Selected Bibliography</h4>\r\n<ul  style=\"list-style-type: disc !important;\">\r\n   <li>Embry-Thompson, Leah D. and Robert K.

It is challenging to assemble and present spending and subsidy data regarding the nonprofit sector because the federal government does not identify nonprofits as a distinct budget category. Further, federal budget data are of uncertain quality; specifically, the data available through USAspending.gov<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a> are incomplete because certain program information is missing for a number of records, making it difficult to discern which specific agencies and programs may be awarding funds to nonprofits.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, while Subsidyscope\u2019s analysis found many data quality issues with grant, contract and risk transfer information, we discovered that the nonprofit sector is overwhelmingly subsidized through indirect means, namely through tax subsidies. Subsidyscope determined that the government data on tax subsidies is generally of higher quality than data on grants, contracts and risk transfers because tax expenditures are estimated by one agency, the Treasury Department, while the data on grants, contracts and risk transfers originate from many different agencies that differ in interpretation of, and compliance with, reporting requirements.  Thus, the highest quality data coincide with the largest source of subsidies to the nonprofit sector. </p>\n\n<p>One of the oldest sectors in our economy, nonprofits have had a constantly evolving relationship with the federal government&mdash;from their roots in colonial voluntary organizations to the robust sector of nearly 1.8 million nonprofits that exists today in the United States.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a> As the Urban Institute reports, in 2007:</p>\n\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc !important;\">\n<li>the nonprofit sector accounted for 5 percent of the United States\u2019 gross domestic product;</li>\n\n<li>the sector owns close to 5 percent of private sector net worth; and </li>\n\n<li>it employs over 8 percent of the labor force (excluding volunteers).<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">3</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Federal Assistance to Nonprofits</h4>\n\n<p>Federal funding to tax-exempt groups continues to grow each year. A 2007 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report cites research estimating that federal support to nonprofits increased about 230 percent from fiscal year 1980 to fiscal year 2004 in real (inflation-adjusted) dollars.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a> The GAO also noted that current data on federal aid to nonprofits is of questionable quality due to frequent inaccuracies in reporting.</p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope looks at four different mechanisms the federal government uses to provide subsidies: tax expenditures (including tax deductions or credits), direct expenditures (including grants), contracts and risk transfers (including loans). Tax expenditures are by far the largest source of federal subsidies to nonprofits.</p>\n\n\n<h4>Tax Expenditures</h4>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope estimates that the federal government lost approximately $50 billion in forgone tax revenue in fiscal year 2008 due to tax expenditures that specifically target activities involving nonprofits, though it is unclear how much of the value of these tax reductions actually reached the nonprofits they were meant to help.<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a> The majority of this loss is due to the tax deduction allowed for charitable donations ($47 billion in fiscal year 2008), for which all of the funds, by definition, reached nonprofits. However, some amount of giving would have taken place whether or not a tax subsidy was available to donors and, therefore, we know that some portion of the subsidy benefited the individuals who gave to nonprofits. The amount of the subsidy that went to nonprofits is dependent on the extent to which the charitable deduction increased the amount of money that individuals donated.</p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope also provides information on other nonprofit-related tax expenditures, such as tax-exempt bonds that are typically issued by state and local governments to finance the construction of facilities used by 501(c)(3) organizations. Additionally, Subsidyscope has assembled a list of tax expenditures that may benefit nonprofits as well as other entities. See more on tax expenditures benefiting nonprofits <a href=\"/nonprofits/tax-expenditures/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Risk Transfers</h4>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope summarizes available data on subsidies that nonprofits receive through federal loan and loan guarantee programs; however, a recent GAO analysis indicates that federal data on risk transfers are of particularly poor quality,<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a> which are likely to understate subsidy costs.</p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope\u2019s examination of 2008 data found that at least $7 billion in loans through 12 federal direct loan programs, and $284 million in loan guarantees through four federal programs, went to nonprofits in fiscal year 2008&mdash;providing subsidies of at least $96 million and $18 million respectively.<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a> Summary tables listing these programs are presented <a href=\"/nonprofits/risk-transfers/\">here</a>.  </p>\n\n<h4>Grants and Contracts</h4>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope analyzed the federal grants data (which are included in direct expenditures) that were marked as going to a nonprofit recipient or a higher education recipient. It is important to note that <i>not all grants contain a subsidy</i>, and if they do, the amount of the grant is not the amount of the subsidy; the subsidy could be much less than the actual grant amount. Based on the government\u2019s data, there are over 1,400 federal programs that provide grants to nonprofits. For instance, social services and research activities are often funded through such grants. Those grants made directly to nonprofits totaled $38 billion in fiscal year 2008, 8 percent of all federal grant spending.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a> </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the government contracts with nonprofits. Contracts, as opposed to grants, are used when the service or goods provided directly benefit the government or when the work is being performed to certain specifications under the government\u2019s supervision. Using USAspending.gov data from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), Subsidyscope analyzed the largest nonprofit contractors and the extent of non-competed contracts that were awarded to nonprofit organizations. Similar to data on grants, these records identify the nonprofit recipients of the contracts. It is important to note that <i>not all non-competed contracts contain a subsidy</i>. Subsidyscope provides data on non-competed contracts simply because such contracts are more likely to contain a subsidy compared to contracts that are openly competed. However, it is impossible to estimate the amount of subsidy, if any, actually delivered to the contractors. </p>\n\n<p>Based on an analysis of the contracts awarded to nonprofits, Subsidyscope found that approximately 52 percent ($10 billion) of those contracts were not competed for fiscal year 2008. Also, this analysis estimates that 73 percent ($13 billion) of all 2008 contracts to nonprofits (competed and non-competed) went to the top 100 recipients (based on the total dollar value of all contracts held) and 44 percent ($8 billion) went to the top 10.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a></p>\n\n<p>See more on grants and contracts to nonprofits <a href=\"/nonprofits/direct-expenditures/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Last updated May 26, 2010.</em></p>\n\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\n <li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>USAspending.gov supplanted the Federal Assistance Award Data System (FAADS), and contains data on federal grants, contracts, loans, loan guarantees and insurance.

Through such funding, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and other agencies provide resources that support both producers and consumers of energy as well as users of energy-related research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, there is little data available to determine how much of the federal spending on energy-related grants and contracts may constitute a subsidy to this sector. In the absence of this information, Subsidyscope provides data on all those direct expenditure programs that are most likely to contain a subsidy in order to better estimate the upper bound of government subsidies in this sector. Not all of the spending in these programs would properly be counted as a subsidy; in some cases, very little of what is spent on a program may be a subsidy. In many cases, especially for competitively-bid contracts, there may be no subsidy at all. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Direct expenditures are easier to measure than spending on other programs containing subsidies, such as tax expenditures or loan programs.  However, users of this data should be aware that the federal data Subsidyscope collects from the government can sometimes be of poor quality, particularly in that there may be omissions.<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on available federal data for fiscal year 2009, the federal government granted a total of $18.6 billion directly to companies or organizations carrying out energy-related work that Subsidyscope deems likely to contain a subsidy. This is just under 3 percent of all government grants over that time period ($716.8 billion). Also during fiscal year 2009, contracts to entities in the energy sector totaled $21.3 billion, about 4 percent of all government contracts ($523 billion). Of those energy contracts, nearly 20 percent, or $4.3 billion, were not competed. Subsidyscope considers non-competed contracts as more likely to contain a subsidy than competed contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Subsidies through Grants</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"charts floatr\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\r\n<h5>Figure 1: Direct Expenditures in the Energy Sector <br/>\r\nFY2000-2009 (billions of nominal dollars)</h5>\r\n<img src=\"/media/images/energy/energy_direct_expenditures_billions.png\"/><br/>\r\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of data from USAspending.gov. Estimates are in nominal dollars and reflect the data as they appear in USAspending.gov at the time of this analysis.\r\n\r\n<br> Note: Data presented are obligations to programs that Subsidyscope deems likely to contain a subsidy. All grant programs in \r\nSubsidyscope's definition of the energy sector are included.</cite>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on Subsidyscope's review, all federal grant programs in the energy sector (see <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> at the bottom of the page) were determined to potentially contain a subsidy (see Section B. 4. of our <a href=\"/methodology/\">methodology</a>). However, even if a grant program does include a subsidy component, estimates of the actual subsidy are often not calculated or made available. Given these limitations, we present all federal spending on programs that may contain a subsidy, as it is the upper bound of what might potentially be a subsidy for the energy sector. </p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Almost 72 percent of the energy-related dollars spent through grant programs in fiscal year 2009 were carried out by DOE. Other agencies that implement energy-related programs include the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of the Interior and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In fiscal year 2009, the five largest grant programs accounted for over 90 percent of the total grants in the energy sector. These programs are briefly described below. See <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> at the bottom of the page for a complete list of programs that Subsidyscope deems likely to contain a subsidy and their corresponding fiscal year 2009 funding amounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest grant in the energy sector for fiscal year 2009 was DOE's Weatherization Assistance for Low-Income Persons Program (WAP), which was allotted $5.6 billion that year. In fiscal year 2009, this program received almost $5.4 billion above previous funding levels as part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 (ARRA), also known as \"stimulus funds.\" This more than twentyfold increase in funding for that program helps explain the spike in direct expenditures depicted in Figure 1, above. Funding in fiscal year 2008, before the spike, was $221 million and the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance projects that funding in fiscal year 2010 will return to the range of $225 million.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a>  DOE funds WAP in order to improve the energy efficiency of low-income homes through the installation of weatherization materials such as attic insulation, caulking, weather-stripping and modifications to heating and cooling systems.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a>  WAP funds are directed to states or state agencies, who in turn administer the funds to eligible beneficiaries. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The second largest grant program in the energy sector for fiscal year 2009 was the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program received $5.1 billion in fiscal year 2009, up from $2.6 billion in fiscal year 2008.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a> LIHEAP grants go to states and other jurisdictions to assist households with energy costs. A portion of these funds may also be used for weatherization of homes.<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third largest grant program in fiscal year 2009, which received a more than hundredfold increase in one-time stimulus funds, is the State Energy Program. In fiscal year 2009, this program was funded at $3.2 billion, up from $30 million in fiscal year 2008. The program's funding is projected to decrease back down to around $70 million in fiscal year 2010.<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a>  This program gives financial and technical assistance to states for energy efficiency and conservation projects with the goal of reducing fossil fuel emissions, reducing energy use and increasing energy efficiency.<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth largest energy-related grant program in fiscal year 2009 was DOE's Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program (EECBG), which was entirely funded by ARRA. This program, which received $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2009, provides funding to states through block grants and has the same objectives as the State Energy program: to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reduce energy use and increase energy efficiency in various sectors.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fifth largest energy-related grant program in fiscal year 2009 was the Office of Science Financial Assistance Program, which received $1.4 billion that year. This program funds research in the basic sciences and advanced technology concepts relating to energy. If funds allocated through ARRA were not included in this analysis, this would be the largest DOE grant program in the energy sector (excluding the HHS grant above), indicating that research is typically one of the largest beneficiaries of DOE energy-related grants. While funding levels for some of the programs mentioned previously decrease in fiscal year 2010, funding for the Office of Science Financial Assistance program is likely to remain at a consistent level in fiscal year 2010.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a> </p>\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Subsidies through Contracts</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to awarding grants, the government directly contracts with other organizations to provide energy-related goods and services, such as fuel, infrastructure maintenance and research. Under a contract, a subsidy occurs when the government pays more than fair market value for a good or service. In many cases it is difficult to determine when a subsidy is included, as the fair market value may be a matter of opinion. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"charts floatr\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\r\n<h5>Figure 2: Non-competed Contracts in the Energy Sector<br/>\r\nFY2000-2009 (billions of nominal dollars)</h5>\r\n<img src=\"/media/images/energy/energy_noncompeted_contracts_billions.png\"/><br/>\r\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of data from USAspending.gov. Estimates are in nominal dollars and reflect the data as they appear in USAspending.gov at the time of this analysis.\r\n\r\n<br> Note: Subsidyscope believes that government spending on non-competed contracts is actually more consistent during this time period than the figure represents, and that the dips reflect poor data resulting from reporting variation, rather than actual decreases in energy-related contracts. See the text below for additional information.</cite>\r\n</div>\r\n \r\n<p>Subsidyscope does not attempt to determine which specific contracts include a subsidy or measure what the subsidy may be. We do presume, however, that competed contracts&mdash;contracts that are subject to an open bidding process&mdash;are generally less likely to have a subsidy component, even though the bidding process may include certain preferences. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope's focus on non-competed contracts reflects the fact that the federal government generally prefers agencies to compete contracts because competition is expected to result in lower costs and/or better quality goods and services.<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a> In contrast, non-competed contracts are generally assumed to be more likely to cost the government more than the fair market value and may be scrutinized solely on the basis that there is not clear justification for why they were not competed. </p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>While all 13,823 non-competed contracts in the energy sector in fiscal year 2009 totaled $4.3 billion, the top 100 contracts totaled nearly $3.7 billion. Seven of these contracts exceeded $100 million each, with recipients including oil and gas companies, a foreign contractor and the Tennessee Valley Authority, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope has previously determined that there can be problems with the quality of the contracts data that are reported by agencies to USAspending.gov. In order to sort government contracts by economic sector, Subsidyscope uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes to match contracts to the appropriate economic sector, or Product Service Codes if NAICS codes are not available. (See Section C of Subsidyscope's methodology <a href=\"/methodology/\">here</a> for more on how contracts are organized by sector.) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, for the data presented in Figure 2 above, Subsidyscope found that there is significant variation in agencies' use of NAICS codes when reporting contracts to USAspending.gov over the ten-year period from fiscal year 2000 to 2009. This trend indicates a general underreporting of contracts in the energy sector, and is also likely responsible for the large drop in the reported number of non-competed contracts in the energy sector from fiscal year 2000 to 2001 and the spike in contracts in fiscal year 2005. Subsidyscope believes that the trend is actually more consistent during this time period than Figure 2 represents, and that the dips reflect poor data resulting from reporting variation, rather than actual decreases in energy-related contracts. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To access Subsidyscope's search interfaces for direct expenditures data from the federal government\u2019s USAspending.gov Web site, <a href=\"/energy/direct-expenditures/search/\">click here for grants</a> and <a href=\"/energy/contracts/search/\">here for non-competed contracts</a>.

Americans use energy to heat and cool homes, fuel vehicles and power industrial processes, among many other things.  In 2008 the United States consumed nearly 100 quadrillion Btu of energy from five key sources: petroleum (37 percent), natural gas (24 percent), coal (23 percent), nuclear electric power (9 percent) and renewable energy (7 percent).<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a> </p>\n\n<p>While energy consumption is intrinsic to the country's wellbeing, there are both large and small downsides to the nation's current energy usage and production patterns. These include: national security concerns related to foreign oil supply; global warming associated with a range of fossil fuels; water pollution from domestic oil spills and ethanol production; potential radiation releases from nuclear power facilities; and the disturbance of natural habitats resulting from hydroelectric dams, among many others. </p>\n\n<p>Government funding of the energy sector supports a wide array of activities, including research and development, assistance to companies that engage in energy production and assistance to low-income citizens, as well as encouragement of greater energy efficiency and conservation.  This support varies by energy type, but influences the entire fuel chain. These activities are also supported through a wide-variety of programs at several federal agencies including, but not limited to, the Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation. </p>\n\n<p>Consistent with our <a href=\"/methodology/\">methodology</a> and the treatment of other economic sectors, Subsidyscope categorizes subsidies for the energy sector into three categories: <a href=\"/energy/direct-expenditures/\">direct expenditures</a> (which consist of <a href=\"/energy/direct-expenditures/search/\">grants</a> and <a href=\"/energy/contracts/search/\">contracts</a>), <a href=\"/energy/tax-expenditures/\">tax expenditures</a> and <a href=\"/energy/risk-transfers/\">risk transfers</a>. In the future, Subsidyscope also plans to provide more information on subsidies delivered through regulations, which we discuss on our <a href=\"/energy/regulations/\">regulatory page</a>.

For a summary of these activities and an overview of Subsidyscope's analyses in these areas, see our <a href=\"/energy/summary/\">summary page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The breadth of federal energy programs reflects the multiple goals the federal government simultaneously pursues in the energy sector. Sometimes these programs conflict with each other. For instance, the federal government promotes the development and use of domestic coal reserves by taxing royalties from coal deposits at a lower rate (see our <a href=\"/energy/tax-expenditures/\">tax expenditures page</a>). This tax subsidy was worth $70 million in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a>  However, burning coal, relative to other sources of energy, releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air,<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a>  and the federal government also carries out a number of programs, such as the renewable fuel standard (see our <a href=\"/energy/regulations/\">regulatory page</a>), that attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a>  Thus one energy program incidentally increases greenhouse gas emissions while another attempts to decrease them.</p>\n\n<p>This overview provides a synopsis of the economic rationale for government intervention in the energy sector, followed by a brief summary of the size and scope of the sector. This Web page also briefly describes related issues relevant to subsidies in the sector, such as electricity production and water usage. Note that this discussion takes a broad look at energy in the United States and is not intended to explore in detail the myriad issues that exist in the sector. Rather, it is intended to serve as general context for examining federal spending on energy-related subsidies. </p>\n\n<h4>Economic Rationale for Government Intervention in the Energy Sector</h4>\n\n<p>From an economic perspective, there are various market failures that serve as a rationale for government intervention in markets. Two such problems account for the primary reasons the government gets involved in the energy sector: externalities and public goods. This is not an attempt to downplay the role that other factors inevitably play in the formulation of government policies, or to imply that the subsidies that currently exist are justified on economic grounds. Rather this section describes the theoretical economic justifications for intervention in the sector. </p>\n\n<h4>Externalities</h4>\n\n<p>When an activity of a person or corporate entity directly affects the wellbeing of another in a way that is not reflected in the activity's market price, that cost (or benefit) is called an externality. Externalities may be negative or positive. In the energy sector, there are various negative externalities, both large and small, such as air pollution from burning fossil fuels, environmental destruction from oil spills and adverse aesthetics from power lines and wind turbines. Economic theory argues for taxing products or services directly if they impose externalities in order to ensure that the price charged for the goods or services reflect their full cost to society, including the cost of the externality.<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a>  Similarly, if there are positive externalities resulting from a particular good or activity, such as a hydroelectric dam providing flood control,<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a> the government could encourage such goods or activities through subsidies that make its price better reflect these benefits.<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a>  As a result, these taxes and subsidies can lead to a more efficient allocation of resources. </p>\n\n\n<h4>Public Goods</h4>\n\n<p>A public good is a product or service that once one person is able to enjoy it, there is no cost for another person to enjoy it (it is <em>nonrivalrous</em>). Further, once public goods are enjoyed by one person, it is difficult or impossible to exclude others from doing so as well (making them <em>nonexcludable</em>).  Public goods include things like firework displays, roads, parks, national defense and knowledge resulting from basic research. Such goods can be consumed collectively by all, but it is typically too expensive to exclude nonpaying users from enjoying them.  The collective nature of public goods makes them at risk for being underprovided by the market; for example, you might not maintain a lighthouse if you know your neighbor will maintain it and you can benefit for free. In economics, this is called free riding. Thus, it may make sense to have the government provide and/or subsidize such goods.</p>\n\n<p>An example of a public good in the energy sector is knowledge obtained from basic research. Research that could lead to the development of clean affordable energy supplies which benefit everyone, but require that someone pay upfront for such knowledge, may be undersupplied because companies that do not pay for the research can wait until the results are available and then use the information to develop their own product, a form of free riding. In order to correct this, the government may support research to encourage firms to make discoveries that will ultimately benefit everyone.</p>\n\n<p>While these two market failures, externalities and public goods, cover a broad range of the rationale for intervening in the energy sector, they do not exhaust the types of market failures in the energy sector. Nor does the presentation of these two market failures intend to justify any particular federal policy choices or spending. Subsidyscope aims to present information and data on federal spending and subsidies, and does not take a position on their value.</p>\n\n<h4>Size, Scope and Composition of the Sector </h4>\n\n<p>The energy sector is instrumental to nearly every other sector in the economy; however, depending on how the sector is defined, it could be considered smaller than most other economic sectors. Based on one definition of the sector, in 2007, the energy sector's gross domestic product (GDP)&mdash;or total economic output&mdash;reached $526 billion, out of a total national GDP of $13.8 trillion that year.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a>   </p>\n\n<p>In 2008, the U.S. consumed 99.3 quadrillion <a href=\"/glossary/#british-thermal-unit\">Btu</a><a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a> of total energy,<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a>  nearly three times as much as in 1950 (34.6 quadrillion Btu) and more than double the amount consumed in 1960 (45.1 quadrillion Btu). On the other hand, it was a small increase over the amount consumed in 2000 (99 quadrillion Btu).<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a>  Normalizing these trends on a per capita basis, the U.S. consumed about 227 million Btu per person in 1950. This consumption grew to more than 350 million Btu per person by 2000, and decreased to about 327 million Btu per person by 2008.<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a> These figures illustrate the gains in efficiency of the country's energy usage. For context, one Btu is \"approximately equal to the energy released in the burning of a wood match \u2026 and one billion Btu equals all the electricity that 300 households consume in one month,\" according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a></p>\n\n<p>Figure 1 below illustrates the primary sources of U.S. energy consumption (petroleum, coal, natural gas, nuclear, renewable, etc.) and the sectors powered by those energy sources. Certain forms of primary energy are more applicable to various end uses. Electricity production, for example, consumed the largest share of the total primary energy supply in 2008.<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a>   Petroleum is largely used to meet transportation needs, though this fuel also powers a portion of industrial and residential uses. The following sections provide a brief overview of the various types of primary energy sources used in the U.S., followed by an overview of the federal electric power production sector and the issue of water use in the energy sector. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"charts full\">\n<h5>Figure 1: U.S. Primary Energy Consumption by Source, 2008</h5>\n<img class=\"chart center\" title=\"Figure 1: U.S. Primary Energy Consumption by Source, 2008\"  src=\"/media/images/energy/us_primary_consumption_by_source.png\"/><br/>\n\n<h5>U.S. Primary Energy Consumption by Sector, by Source, 2008</h5>\n<ul class=\"charts horizontal\">\n<li>\n    <h6 style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Electric</h6>\n    <img src=\"/media/images/energy/us_primary_consumption_by_source_by_sector_electric.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>\n    <h6 style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Transportation</h6>\n    <img src=\"/media/images/energy/us_primary_consumption_by_source_by_sector_transportation.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>\n    <h6 style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Industrial</h6>\n    <img src=\"/media/images/energy/us_primary_consumption_by_source_by_sector_industrial.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>\n    <h6 style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Residential & Commercial</h6>\n    <img src=\"/media/images/energy/us_primary_consumption_by_source_by_sector_rescom.png\" />\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of data from Energy Information Administration, \"<a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/FTPROOT/multifuel/038408.pdf\">Annual Energy Review 2008.</a>\" \nJune 2009. Tables 1.3; 2.1b - 2.1f.<br/>\nNote: Figure 1 \"illustrates the supply and demand of primary energy only; total energy used by the residential and commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors comprises the primary energy used by each sector plus that sector's share of all primary energy supplied to the electric power sector to generate the electricity that is subsequently used by the sector.\" EIA notes the numbers are \"preliminary.\" Further, coal cokes net imports and net electricity imports are excluded from presentation in the chart, but make up 0.04 percent and 0.11 percent, respectively.\nElectric includes electricity-only and combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plants whose primary business is to sell electricity, or electricity and heat to the public. Industrial includes industrial CHP plants and industrial electricity-only plants. Residential and Commercial includes CHP and commercial electricity-only plants. For electric chart, imports comprise 0.3 percent of the total. </cite>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h6>Crude Oil</h6>\n\n<p>More of the energy consumed in the U.S. comes from petroleum (37 percent in 2008) than from any other source.<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a>  Energy related oil and petroleum products include gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil and propane. In 2008, the U.S. consumed 19.5 million barrels of petroleum per day,<a href=\"#footnote-16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a>  but produced only 6.7 million barrels per day,<a href=\"#footnote-17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a>   meaning that roughly 34 percent of the nation's petroleum needs were supplied from domestic sources. Seventy-one percent of the petroleum consumed was used in meeting transportation needs, 23 percent was used by the industrial sector, 5 percent was used by the residential and commercial sector, and about 1 percent was used for electricity.<a href=\"#footnote-18\" class=\"footnote\">18</a>  See Figure 1 for more on primary energy sources and their end uses. </p>\n\n<p>U.S. petroleum use accounted for 23 percent of total worldwide consumption for 2008, with China and Japan following, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Within the U.S. that same year, California used about 11 percent of total U.S. consumption, with Texas at 10 percent and Florida at 6 percent.<a href=\"#footnote-19\" class=\"footnote\">19</a></p>\n\n<p>Some of the subsidies available to the oil, petroleum and natural gas industries (see the next section for a discussion of natural gas) include tax expenditures that Subsidyscope discusses <a href=\"/energy/tax-expenditures/\">here</a>, such as the expensing of exploration and development for fuels, the ability for companies to deduct a percentage of the cost of drilling or mining for fuels and the temporary 50 percent expensing provision for equipment used in refining liquid fuels. These three subsidies combined resulted in an estimated revenue loss for the federal government of $2.8 billion in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a></p>\n\n<p>Further, the oil and gas industry receives an implicit subsidy to produce oil and gas on federal lands through a regulatory subsidy called \"royalty relief,\" or a reduction in the amount of royalties these companies must pay to the federal government in return for extracting its natural resources. As Subsidyscope explains in more detail <a href=\"/energy/regulations/\">here</a>,  royalty relief is a subsidy to oil and gas producers that is intended to promote domestic oil and gas production, thereby reducing oil and gas imports. Unfortunately, there is no overall estimate of the total subsidy provided by royalty relief, but government estimates for specific areas indicate it is in the billions of dollars every year. For instance, in 2008 the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated the cost of royalty relief for deep water areas in the Gulf of Mexico for the four years from 1996 to 2000 to be between $21 billion and $53 billion.<a href=\"#footnote-21\" class=\"footnote\">21</a></p>\n\n<h6>Natural Gas</h6>\n\n<p>In 2008, natural gas supplied about 24 percent of total U.S. energy use, with 21.2 quadrillion Btu of dry natural gas produced in the U.S., and 23.8 quadrillion Btu consumed that same year.<a href=\"#footnote-22\" class=\"footnote\">22</a>   In 2008, the U.S. imported about 12.7 percent of natural gas it consumed.<a href=\"#footnote-23\" class=\"footnote\">23</a>  Natural gas was used evenly by the industrial sector and the residential and commercial sectors&mdash;both at about 34 percent each. Twenty-nine percent of the natural gas consumed was used by the electric power sector and three percent was used for transportation.<a href=\"#footnote-24\" class=\"footnote\">24</a>  </p>\n\n<p>U.S. production and consumption of natural gas has increased over the past few years (from 2006 to 2009), while imports have dropped (from 2007 to 2009).<a href=\"#footnote-25\" class=\"footnote\">25</a>  Natural gas is the main heating fuel for slightly more than half of the homes in the U.S., and is also used to fuel stoves, water heaters, clothes dryers and other household appliances.<a href=\"#footnote-26\" class=\"footnote\">26</a> </p>\n\n<p>In addition to the subsidies for the oil, petroleum and natural gas industries highlighted in the previous section, an additional tax subsidy specific to the natural gas industry allows firms to accelerate the depreciation of their natural gas pipelines when calculating how much to write off for tax purposes. This resulted in an estimated revenue loss of $80 million to the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-27\" class=\"footnote\">27</a> </p>\n\n<h6>Coal</h6>\n\n<p>In 2008, nearly 1.2 billion <a href=\"/glossary/#short-ton\">short tons</a> of coal were consumed in the U.S. Virtually all of this coal came from domestic mines.<a href=\"#footnote-28\" class=\"footnote\">28</a>  Roughly 91 percent of domestic coal resources were used to produce electricity in 2008, with most of the remaining balance used for industrial purposes.<a href=\"#footnote-29\" class=\"footnote\">29</a>  Despite its heavy use to produce electricity, it generates only about half of the electricity the nation consumes,<a href=\"#footnote-30\" class=\"footnote\">30</a>  and about a quarter of total U.S. primary energy consumption.<a href=\"#footnote-31\" class=\"footnote\">31</a>  The U.S. has exported about 5 percent of its coal, on average, over the past 10 years, and some plants in the U.S. import coal when it is cheaper than having it shipped from domestic mines.<a href=\"#footnote-32\" class=\"footnote\">32</a></p> \n\n<p>While coal is an inexpensive and abundant primary energy source for electricity, relative to other energy sources, when burned it has higher carbon dioxide emissions than oil and natural gas,<a href=\"#footnote-33\" class=\"footnote\">33</a>  and also emits air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury, which have been linked to health and environmental damage. Further, coal extraction is associated with other externalities such as occupational risks, negative impacts on ecosystems, and the adverse alteration of landscapes and scenic views in areas where it is mined.<a href=\"#footnote-34\" class=\"footnote\">34</a> </p>\n\n<p>There are several specific tax subsidies to the coal industry. For example, the tax credit for investment in clean coal facilities resulted in an estimated loss to the Treasury of $180 million in fiscal year 2009, while the treatment of royalties from coal as capital gains income, rather than ordinary income, cost the Treasury an estimated $70 million that same year.<a href=\"#footnote-35\" class=\"footnote\">35</a> </p>\n\n<h6>Renewable Energy</h6>\n\n<p>Renewable energy<a href=\"#footnote-36\" class=\"footnote\">36</a>  includes biomass (wood and wood waste, municipal solid waste, landfill gas, biogas and ethanol or biodiesel), hydropower (water), geothermal, wind and solar energy. These sources of energy are replaced in nature over a relatively short time frame, whereas fossil energy replacement is very long compared to the human time scale. In 2008, renewable energy sources provided about 7 percent of total energy consumption in the U.S. (7.3 quadrillion Btu).<a href=\"#footnote-37\" class=\"footnote\">37</a>  About half of this renewable energy was used for electricity generation (51 percent), 28 percent was harnessed by the industrial sector, 11 percent was used for transportation purposes, and 10 percent was employed by the residential and commercial sectors.<a href=\"#footnote-38\" class=\"footnote\">38</a> </p>\n\n<p>The largest source of renewable energy is biomass, which comprised 53 percent of renewable energy in 2008.<a href=\"#footnote-39\" class=\"footnote\">39</a>  Biomass includes ethanol, which is an alcohol fuel made from the sugars in various grains or other crops, such as corn, barley, sugar cane or rice.<a href=\"#footnote-40\" class=\"footnote\">40</a>  In the U.S., virtually all of the ethanol produced is used to make \"E10\" or \"gasohol,\" a mixture of 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline. Biodiesel is a biodegradable fuel made from vegetable oils, fats or greases&mdash;such as recycled restaurant grease.<a href=\"#footnote-41\" class=\"footnote\">41</a>  Because almost all biomass fuel resources rely on land and other inputs such as water and fertilizer, their environmental profiles vary widely depending on the feedstock and production systems used to grow them.</p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., hydropower produces the most electricity of all renewable energy sources; it accounted for 6 percent of total U.S. electricity generation and 67 percent of electrical generation from renewables in 2008.<a href=\"#footnote-42\" class=\"footnote\">42</a>  That same year, wind machines generated about 1.3 percent of total U.S. electricity generation, or enough to power about 4.6 million households for the year.<a href=\"#footnote-43\" class=\"footnote\">43</a>  In 2008, U.S. geothermal power plants, located solely in 7 western states, produced 0.4 percent of total U.S. electricity generation.<a href=\"#footnote-44\" class=\"footnote\">44</a>  </p>\n\n<h6>Nuclear </h6>\n\n<p>According to DOE, as of 2009, there were 104 commercial nuclear reactors operating at 65 power plants in 31 states, producing about 20 percent of U.S. electricity.<a href=\"#footnote-45\" class=\"footnote\">45</a>   In 2008, all of the nuclear electric power produced in the U.S. was used for producing electric power.<a href=\"#footnote-46\" class=\"footnote\">46</a> Thirty-one countries have commercial nuclear reactors. The U.S. has the largest aggregate generating capacity in the world. The second highest producer, France, relies on nuclear electric power for 80 percent of its electricity.<a href=\"#footnote-47\" class=\"footnote\">47</a> \n</p>\n\n<p>One advantage of nuclear power is that it generates very few, if any, carbon emissions.<a href=\"#footnote-48\" class=\"footnote\">48</a>  Yet this type of power does have serious problems regarding waste disposal and the risk of an accident that could result in the release of radioactive material. For a discussion of the Price Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act, which provides a subsidy to companies licensed to operate nuclear power plants, see Subsidyscope's <a href=\"/energy/risk-transfers/\">risk transfers page</a>. </p>\n\n<h4>Federal Electricity Programs</h4>\n\n<p>The previous section briefly discussed the primary sources of energy and some of the specific subsidies the U.S. government conveys to those industries. Electricity is an example of a secondary power source produced from the primary energy sources discussed above. Electricity is neither renewable nor non-renewable; rather the sources from which it originates can be either.<a href=\"#footnote-49\" class=\"footnote\">49</a>  As Figure 2 below illustrates, most of the electricity in the U.S. is generated from coal, followed by natural gas and nuclear power.<a href=\"#footnote-50\" class=\"footnote\">50</a>  While the federal government's subsidization of private electricity generators is captured in the subsidies provided to producers of primary energy sources (such as coal), the federal government also has several programs that directly support electricity production, transmission, distribution and consumption. For example, the government directly provides relatively low cost electricity in certain areas, provides loans and tax exemptions to some electricity producers and funds electricity-related research and development. These subsidies are discussed in more detail below.</p>\n\n<div class=\"charts floatr\" style=\"width: 490px;\">\n<h5>Figure 2: U.S. Electric Power Sector Energy <br/>\nConsumption, by Primary Source, 2008</h5>\n<img src=\"/media/images/energy/US_electric_power_industry_net_generation_2008.png\"/><br/>\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of data from Energy Information Administration, \"<a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/FTPROOT/multifuel/038408.pdf\">Annual Energy Review 2008</a>.\" June 2009. Table 2.1f. p. 45. <br>\nNote: Net electricity imports comprise 0.3 percent of the fuels consumed to produce electricity. </cite>\n</div>\n\n<p>The federal government owns or implicitly backs several electricity-producing utilities, including the Federal Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), which include the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Western Area Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration, the Southeastern Power Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). These utilities are statutorily obligated to provide below-market-cost power to their beneficiaries. In doing so, they provide electricity to state and local utilities or cooperatives which then sell the power at a reduced cost to residential or commercial customers.<a href=\"#footnote-51\" class=\"footnote\">51</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Among the most common government mechanisms to support electric utilities is providing access to capital with reduced interest rates. As the EIA explains, \"[t]he benefits derive from the Federal utilities' ability to borrow directly from the Treasury, sell bonds to the public in the case of TVA, or assume payment of debt obligations of third parties in the case of BPA, at interest rates that reflect investors' perception that such obligations are guaranteed by the Federal government.\"<a href=\"#footnote-52\" class=\"footnote\">52</a>   The credit rating agencies recognized by the Securities and Exchange Commission indicate that this perception improves the PMA's and TVA's creditworthiness.<a href=\"#footnote-53\" class=\"footnote\">53</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, publicly-owned utilities benefit from the ability to borrow at reduced interest rates through the issuance of tax-exempt debt.  In some cases, they issue the debt themselves, as the TVA does.  In other cases, state and municipal utilities may issue tax-exempt debt on behalf of third parties, such as to utilities for pollution control equipment (a tax expenditure that is listed on our <a href=\"/energy/tax-expenditures/\">tax subsidies page</a>). In addition to these tax subsidies, electric cooperatives and publicly-owned utilities are tax-exempt and therefore receive an implicit subsidy.<a href=\"#footnote-54\" class=\"footnote\">54</a>   However, this subsidy is not calculated nor presented by the government, and therefore the tax exemption is not included in this analysis.<a href=\"#footnote-55\" class=\"footnote\">55</a>   </p>\n\n<p>The federal government also indirectly supports electricity through loans and loan guarantees made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) to rural electric cooperatives at low rates. Federal support of electricity loans and loan guarantees through the RUS programs totaled $21.9 billion from fiscal year 2002 to 2007.<a href=\"#footnote-56\" class=\"footnote\">56</a>  For more information on those programs, see Subsidyscope's <a href=\"/energy/risk-transfers/\">page on risk transfers in the energy sector</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Further, much of the benefits of federal spending on research and development (R&D) in the energy sector accrue to both private and federal electricity generators. The GAO found that over the 5 year period from fiscal years 2002 to 2007, electricity-related R&D grew by 35 percent (from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion).<a href=\"#footnote-57\" class=\"footnote\">57</a>  This includes funding for nuclear power (which received the most electricity-related R&D funding), fossil fuels and renewable programs. </p>\n\n<h4>Water</h4>\n\n<p>The previous sections focused on sources of energy. Another important element of the energy sector is that of water use for energy production and transportation. Water is a vital intermediate input to energy resource development in that it is used in extracting, refining, processing and transporting fuels. Understanding how water influences the energy sector can be important in understanding how the government may indirectly subsidize energy through water subsidies.</p>\n  \n<p>Water is a significant input to electric power generation.  It is used directly, for example, to generate electricity at hydroelectric plants and indirectly at other electric generating facilities for cooling and emissions control. In many cases water is only temporarily used in the energy sector.  Often, water is withdrawn from a source and, shortly thereafter, returned to that same source for further reuse. But in many cases, water is withdrawn and used in a way that either contaminates the water requiring further processing or disposal (such as coal mine tailings<a href=\"#footnote-58\" class=\"footnote\">58</a>) or otherwise removes water from further use from its original source (such as evaporation from a cooling tower or reservoir<a href=\"#footnote-59\" class=\"footnote\">59</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Water is also a significant resource for energy transportation. By one estimate, almost 50 percent of the total tonnage moved through domestic waterways is coal and oil shipments which benefit from subsidized channel or port-deepening projects.<a href=\"#footnote-60\" class=\"footnote\">60</a> </p>\n\n<p>To the extent water use is subsidized, the energy sector also benefits from these subsidies. However, Subsidyscope's analysis of the energy sector does not currently take water subsidies into account. First, there is a lack of data and quantification on federal spending and subsidies in the area of water for energy production and use. Secondly, spending on subsidy programs involving water used for energy is not classified by the federal government in a manner that allows for aggregation. These gaps in existing research as well as government recordkeeping point to an area in need of further research. </p>\n\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"/energy/summary/\">Summary of Energy Sector</a> | <a href=\"/energy/direct-expenditures/\">Direct Expenditures</a> | <a href=\"/energy/tax-expenditures/\">Tax Expenditures</a> | <a href=\"/energy/risk-transfers/\">Risk Transfers</a> | <a href=\"/energy/regulations/\">Regulations</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Last updated September 9, 2010.</em></p>\n\n\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\n\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>Energy Information Administration (EIA). \"<a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/FTPROOT/multifuel/038408.pdf\">Annual Energy Review 2008</a>.\" June 2009.

Tax expenditures have a similar effect on the federal deficit as government spending. They can also have effects on recipients that are similar to grants or other types of subsidies.

See p. 213. </cite>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 24 specific tax expenditures identified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) as serving the energy sector, though only a few of these provisions account for most of the revenue lost to tax subsidies.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a> The top six of these tax expenditures totaled $4.8 billion, or over 75 percent of all energy-related tax expenditures in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a> Some tax expenditures such as the allowance for accelerated depreciation and the foreign tax credit, that benefit businesses broadly across the economy, including the energy sector, are not included in these aggregate estimates.<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope divided the energy tax expenditures reported by Treasury into four categories: those that support fossil fuels, those that support renewable or alternative fuels (e.g., bio-diesel), those that support energy efficiency or conservation, and those that are 'multi-use,' in that they are used in the energy sector but are available across various industries, and cannot be placed in one of the first three categories. The federal government provided incentives through the tax code of $3.2 billion to support fossil fuels; $1.5 billion to support renewable and alternative fuels; $1.2 billion to encourage energy efficiency or conservation; and $430 million for multi-use tax expenditures, in fiscal year 2009 (see Table 1). All four categories combined resulted in an estimated $6.3 billion loss to government revenue in fiscal year 2009, a slight increase over the revenue loss in recent years. Note that estimates of the revenue lost to tax expenditures change each year and can vary dramatically depending on legislative actions and economic conditions. Energy sector tax expenditures averaged roughly $4 billion per year over fiscal years 2000 through 2008, and fossil fuels have been the largest beneficiary of tax subsidies in the time period for which Subsidyscope has data. (See <a href=\"#box1\">Box 1</a> for historical tax expenditure trends by category.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listed below are the tax expenditures reported by the Treasury, and assigned to the energy sector in the fiscal year 2011 edition of the <em>Analytical Perspectives</em> supplement to the President's Budget;

Includes 'Payments in Lieu of Tax Credits' in the FY2009-15 estimates.\r\n</cite>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Various federal taxes and exceptions to such taxes are specifically linked to energy production, consumption or efficiency, such as the income tax credit for energy efficiency improvements or the excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels. Subsidyscope relies on the Treasury's estimates of tax expenditures in the corporate and individual income tax, which are compiled in the <em>Analytical Perspectives</em> of the President's Budget. (See Subsidyscope's page <a href=\"/tax-subsidies/\">here</a> for more on the differences between existing government estimates and on tax expenditures, generally.) </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So far, Subsidyscope has not included excise taxes, or reductions in excise taxes, in our tally of subsidies because Subsidyscope relies on the estimates of tax expenditures presented in the President's Budget, which do not include excise tax expenditures.<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a>  Subsidyscope intends to examine the issue of excise taxes and exceptions to excise taxes in the future.  Such taxes and exceptions to those taxes exist in the energy sector. For example, the ethanol tax credit, which is an exception to the excise tax on motor fuel, is estimated to have reduced excise taxes by $3 billion in fiscal year 2007 and is expected to exceed $5 billion in reduced payments by fiscal year 2010, according to the Energy Information Administration.<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a> </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The following section discusses the energy-related income tax subsidies that resulted in the greatest loss of revenue to the federal government in fiscal year 2009. For that year, these six tax expenditures accounted for more than three-quarters of the estimated revenue loss to the Treasury. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Description of Top Energy-Related Tax Expenditures</h4>\r\n\r\n<h6>Expensing of Exploration and Development Costs</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>In fiscal year 2009, the largest tax expenditure in the energy sector was the allowance of expensing of exploration and development costs of fuels, with an estimated revenue loss of $1.6 billion.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a> Some of the costs of exploration and development of oil, gas and certain other fuels, also called \"intangible drilling costs\" (IDCs), are part of the incidental and necessary expenditures of preparing a site for oil production. These costs include labor and repairs to drilling equipment, among other expenditures. Under a normal income tax, the rules would allow depreciation of these costs before the calculation of taxes owed, but not full expensing. This ability to immediately expense exploration and development costs decreases the amount of income that can be taxed, thus creating a subsidy.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a>  Originally implemented in 1916, this subsidy is based on the rationale that it reduces uncertainty for oil companies and encourages exploration, which can increase domestic production, reduce imports and enhance energy security.<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its assessment of this expensing provision, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) notes that this subsidy may reduce dependence on imported oil in the short run, but it may deplete the nation's oil resources more quickly in the long run. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) notes that the rationale for this tax subsidy has shifted over time, saying that earlier advocates argued that the costs of exploration and development were ordinary operating expenses, while more recently proponents also argue that oil and natural gas are strategic natural resources essential to the nation's security.<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Payments for Specified Energy Property in Lieu of Tax Credits</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 (ARRA) of 2009 authorized a program through which owners of certain energy property, such as wind farms, who place the property into service for renewable energy projects can receive cash grants in lieu of investment tax credits (ITCs). The Treasury estimates the effect of this grant on outlays to be $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2009 with further increases in fiscal years 2010 and 2011.<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Administered by the Treasury with assistance from the Department of Energy (DOE), the program's guidance notes that demand for investment tax credits had diminished. By offering grants in lieu of tax credits, firms can receive a benefit regardless of their tax liability. According to the guidance, the program will boost investment in renewable energy projects, in order to create jobs in the near-term and expand clean and renewable energy in the long-term.<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this program is not presented in the table of energy sector tax expenditures in the President's Fiscal Year 2011 Budget, it is presented in a footnote to the table.<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a> Subsidyscope included the program in the tax expenditure total because its revenue effects are calculated by the Treasury in this footnote.  Further, OMB determined that this grant is not considered federal financial assistance,<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a> and as such it will not ultimately be reported to USAspending.gov and captured in Subsidyscope's database of direct expenditures. However, the program differs from a standard tax expenditure in that the beneficiary information is publicly available on the Treasury Web site.<a href=\"#footnote-16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Temporary 50 Percent Expensing for Equipment Used in the Refining of Liquid Fuels</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The Energy Policy Act of 2005 temporarily allows refineries to expense half of the cost of qualified refinery equipment, with no limit on the amount of the deduction. The remaining half of the cost is subject to normal tax depreciation rules.<a href=\"#footnote-17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a>  For fiscal year 2009, the estimated revenue loss for this temporary expensing provision was $770 million.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>Credit for Energy Efficiency Improvements to Existing Homes</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress passed provisions allowing homeowners to claim a tax credit if they retrofit their homes with energy efficient materials that reduce heat loss in the winter and cooling loss in the summer or if they use more energy efficient heating or cooling systems.<a href=\"#footnote-18\" class=\"footnote\">18</a> In fiscal year 2009, the estimated revenue loss for subsidizing energy efficiency improvements to existing homes through this tax credit totaled $570 million. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>New Technology Credit (Also Called the Energy Production Credit) </h6>\r\n\r\n<p>In fiscal year 2009, the new technology credit cost the government an estimated $430 million. The President's FY2011 budget notes that this credit is for \"certain electricity produced from wind energy, biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, or qualified hydropower and sold to an unrelated party. In addition to the electricity production credit, an income tax credit is allowed for the production of refined coal and Indian coal at qualified facilities.\"<a href=\"#footnote-19\" class=\"footnote\">19</a>  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Excess of Percentage Over Cost Depletion</h6>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"charts floatr\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\r\n<h5>Figure 2: Percentage Depletion Allowance </br/>\r\nfrom FY 1998 to FY 2015<br/>\r\n($ millions)</h5>\r\n<img src=\"/media/images/energy/depletion_allowance.png\"/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nSource: Subsidyscope analysis of <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/spec.pdf\">Analytical Perspectives</a>, OMB. President's Budget, Fiscal Years, 2000-2011. \r\nNumbers provided are from the most recent estimate available. <br/>\r\nNote: Tax expenditure estimates and projections are based on current law as of December 31, 2009.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to expensing intangible drilling costs, certain natural resource extraction companies may be able to deduct a portion of their gross income related to the use and depletion of the asset itself (e.g., oil or mineral reserve) in order to recover part of their capital investment in the resource. In fiscal year 2009, the estimated revenue loss for this tax subsidy was $340 million.<a href=\"#footnote-20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a> It has been much higher in past years, peaking at over $1.2 billion in 2004, and is projected to increase again after fiscal year 2009 (see Figure 2). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, accounting practices allow firms to deduct the cost of the depletion of assets from gross income before calculating taxes owed; this allows for the recovery of the capital investment over the period the assets produce income. However, under percentage depletion, firms may deduct a fixed percentage of the \"gross income\" or revenue they receive from the sale of the mineral. CRS notes that deducting costs this way typically means the deductions exceed the costs of the capital invested in acquiring and developing the reserve.<a href=\"#footnote-21\" class=\"footnote\">21</a> Similar to the expensing of exploration and development costs, this subsidy is created by allowing a reduction in taxable income higher than that which would be allowed under normal accounting practices. The subsidy in this case is the difference between what the firm would have received using cost depletion and percentage depletion.<a href=\"#footnote-22\" class=\"footnote\">22</a> <p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Broad, Cross-sectoral Tax Expenditures</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are various tax expenditures that are used in the energy sector but are available to industries across the economy. The revenue loss of these provisions is not always calculated by the government at the sector level. Where estimates are available, such as for the \"Credit for holding clean energy renewable bonds,\" Subsidyscope provides them and includes them in Table 1. For others, such as accelerated depreciation, there is some research indicating that the benefits to the energy sector are disproportionately higher than other sectors that are less capital intensive.  Unfortunately, reliable estimates of the portion that goes to the energy sector are not yet available.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>Accelerated Depreciation and Foreign Tax Credit</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>When a business asset loses value over time it is said to <a href=\"/glossary/#depreciation\">depreciate</a>; such a loss is considered one of the costs of doing business. Special tax depreciation rules can be used to encourage or discourage some types of investments over other investments, which introduces a subsidy. The U.S. tax code allows for accelerated depreciation of certain capital, which means that the tax depreciation is more rapid than economic depreciation. Because the energy sector is very capital and infrastructure intensive, it is likely that it benefits from this tax expenditure to a higher proportion than its share of GDP. In fact, experts note that nuclear power and electricity generated from renewable sources receive particularly generous tax treatment from accelerated depreciation.<a href=\"#footnote-23\" class=\"footnote\">23</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the government does not currently publish energy-specific tax expenditure estimates of accelerated depreciation so these subsidies are omitted from our estimate of tax expenditure subsidies. To remedy this, Subsidyscope has requested data from the IRS that will allow us to analyze accelerated depreciation by sector and, eventually, include these benefits in our totals for this and other sectors. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Companies in the energy sector, as well as in other sectors, may also benefit from tax provisions such as the Foreign Tax Credit. This tax provision allows companies to take a credit on their U.S. income tax return for certain foreign taxes paid, in order to reduce double taxation.<a href=\"#footnote-24\" class=\"footnote\">24</a>  Similar to accelerated depreciation, the government does not currently publish energy-specific tax expenditure estimates of the foreign tax credit so these subsidies are omitted from our estimate of tax expenditure subsidies. Subsidyscope is exploring ways to reliably identify and assign this tax advantage to individual sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"/energy/summary/\">Summary of Energy Sector</a> | <a href=\"/energy/summary/structure/\">Structure of Energy Sector</a> |  <a href=\"/energy/direct-expenditures/\">Direct Expenditures</a> | <a href=\"/energy/risk-transfers/\">Risk Transfers</a> | <a href=\"/energy/regulations/\">Regulations</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Last updated September 9, 2010.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\r\n\r\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>Number derived by adding up the tax expenditures in Table 1.

However, it is evident from the examples presented below that regulatory requirements can dramatically influence specific energy markets by providing large benefits to particular producers or consumers. This section describes a few energy-related regulations and the subsidies they provide. The regulations presented here do not exhaust all the regulations that provide energy subsidies but are intended to illustrate how regulations may significantly impact energy markets.</p>\n\n<h4>Oil and Gas Royalty Relief</h4>\n\n<p>The U.S. Department of the Interior (Interior) is required by law to ensure that \"the United States receive fair market value of the use of public lands and their resources unless otherwise provided for by statute.\"<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a>  Thus, companies producing oil and natural gas from wells on Interior land or in Interior-administered waters of the outer continental shelf are required to pay the federal government royalties based on a percentage of the value of the petroleum products they extract and sell. Federal royalties are typically in the range of 12.5 percent to 18.75 percent and, in total, result in revenues in the billions of dollars a year.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a>  In 2007, for instance, the United States collected approximately $9 billion in royalties from oil and gas production wells.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a> </p>\n\n<p>Notwithstanding the legal requirement that the United States be fairly compensated for the use of its resources, various laws authorize the Secretary of the Interior to reduce the amount of royalties companies would otherwise pay for extracting oil and gas from Interior-administered property.<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a> The reduction in royalties, also known as royalty relief, is intended to promote domestic oil and gas production, thereby reducing oil and gas imports. The authority to provide royalty relief is executed through regulations promulgated by Interior.   </p>\n\n<p>Government estimates of royalty relief in some areas indicate it can be in the billions of dollars every year. For instance, in 2008 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated the cost of royalty relief for deep water areas in the Gulf of Mexico from 1996 to 2000 to be between $21 billion and $53 billion.<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a> </p>\n\n<p>However, demonstrating the complexity of regulatory subsidies, it may be impossible to estimate just how much of these forgone revenues are a subsidy. The federal government auctions off the right to develop oil and gas fields. When companies bid on the right to explore and develop a field, they do so with the expectation that they may receive royalty relief in the future. The higher the expected royalty relief, the higher the bid the company is willing to offer. Thus, as CBO points out, \u201c[o]ver the long run, net receipts to the government might not change much.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a> Royalty relief may only create a positive subsidy if the actual royalty relief eventually provided to the company exceeds the company\u2019s expectations at the time they made their bid.</p>\n\n<h4>The Renewable Fuel Standard</h4>\n\n<p>The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program provides a subsidy within the energy sector.  The RFS mandates that a minimum volume of transportation fuel sold in the United States come from renewable sources.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a> This legal requirement is implemented through regulations issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a> Specifically, the law establishes three categories of renewable fuels (cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel) with minimum annual volume requirements for each category ramping up to an overall requirement that at least 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel be blended into gasoline and diesel fuel by 2022.<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a>  In addition, each category of fuel must meet certain greenhouse gas emission standards.<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a>  The stated goals of the program include reducing reliance on oil and encouraging the development of domestic renewable fuels that may decrease greenhouse gas emissions. </p>\n\n<p>To the extent the RFS mandate results in greater demand for renewable fuels (predominantly ethanol) and biofuel feedstocks (predominantly corn, soybeans and switchgrass), the RFS regulations provide a subsidy to renewable fuel producers and farmers who grow the feedstocks. Quantifying the value of these subsidies is difficult to do with accuracy given the uncertainty of fuel prices, production technology and crop yields over the next decade.  Nonetheless, a 2010 EPA analysis estimates that the RFS program will boost farm income alone by approximately $13 billion through 2022 (in 2007 dollars).<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a></p>\n\n<h4>Environmental Response and Cleanup</h4>\n\n<p>Energy development and production activities, particularly the extraction of coal, uranium and oil, can result in environmental harm that, in some cases, is cleaned up by the federal government without compensation from the company that caused the harm. A number of programs, implemented through regulation and funded by the federal government, fit into this category.  Such programs include, but are not limited to, the Office of Environmental Management (U.S. Department of Energy),<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a>  Superfund<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a>  and abandoned mine reclamation.<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a></p>\n\n<p>In some cases the cost of cleanup is at least partially borne by the energy sector even if the responsible party does not bear the full cost of cleanup.  For instance, federal grants to states for reclaiming abandoned coal mines are funded through fees paid by existing coal companies. Likewise, a tax on oil has been used in the past to help fund Superfund cleanups. Nonetheless, to the extent that fees, taxes and other revenues collected by the federal government from the energy sector do not cover the cost of federal response and cleanup from energy activities, the difference represents a subsidy to the energy sector.  </p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"/energy/summary/\">Summary of Energy Sector</a> | <a href=\"/energy/summary/structure/\">Structure of Energy Sector</a> |  <a href=\"/energy/direct-expenditures/\">Direct Expenditures</a> |  <a href=\"/energy/tax-expenditures/\">Tax Expenditures</a> | <a href=\"/energy/risk-transfers/\">Risk Transfers</a> </p>\n\n\n<p><em>Last updated September 9, 2010.</em></p>\n\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>See section B.1. of Subsidyscope\u2019s methodology for a brief description of regulatory subsidies. Some argue that a government subsidy occurs when the government fails to correct problems through regulations resulting in certain goods or services being under-priced. For instance, they argue that a government\u2019s failure to adequately regulate greenhouse gas emissions results in coal being under-priced; resulting in a subsidy for coal companies. Subsidyscope does not take this approach. In practice, it would be very difficult to identify and measure under-regulated market failures. Deciding the appropriate level of regulation is a central function of government. Subsidyscope makes no judgment regarding whether a particular activity or market is over- or under-regulated.</li>\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>\"<a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=$$xa$$busc43.wais&start=3505171&SIZE=12212&TYPE=TEXT\">Federal Land Policy and Management Act</a>.\" U.S. Code 43, Section 1701(a)(9). 2007 ed., pg. 472.

The government implements dozens of energy policies and programs subsidizing research, domestic energy production, energy efficiency and many other activities. Even as it tries to hold down the price of traditional fossil fuels such as oil and gas, the government also supports greener alternatives and seeks to reduce energy consumption. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope found that the federal government spent almost $25 billion in fiscal year 2009 on grants and tax expenditures likely to include subsidies in the energy sector. This excludes significant, yet unquantified, subsidies provided through regulations, loans, loan guarantees and contracts. Despite its wide-ranging involvement, the government actually plays a smaller role in the energy sector of the economy than it does in other sectors such as housing or transportation.<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a>  That said, federal grants alone to the energy sector quadrupled to over $18 billion in fiscal year 2009, due in large part to stimulus funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope relies on federal data to calculate these estimates, and as such, any data quality issues in the government\u2019s data will be reflected in our analysis. As <a href=\"/data-quality/\">previously noted</a>, Subsidyscope believes there are <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/clearspending/\">significant problems with some of the government\u2019s information</a>. However, it is the best data available and it provides a baseline for assessing federal intervention through subsidies in each economic sector relative to other sectors. By publishing these estimates, the data are more accessible and their shortcomings can be more easily identified and, ultimately, improved. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Federal Activities and Subsidies in the Energy Sector</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) alone spent about $13.3 billion in the energy sector in fiscal year 2009, while other federal agencies also paid out billions in this area, either directly or indirectly. Through tax credits and deductions, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) was responsible for $6.3 billion in energy-related spending in fiscal year 2009. During the same period, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) spent $5.1 billion to help low-income families afford their heating bills. Total federal spending on tax expenditures and grant programs likely to contain subsidies to the energy sector totaled $24.9 billion in fiscal year 2009. (This estimate does not include potential subsidies through regulations, loans, loan guarantees and contracts, which were not systematically estimated by the government.) Historically, such spending has been much lower. For example, federal spending on energy sector grants that are likely to contain a subsidy have averaged just over $4 billion a year from fiscal years 2000 through 2008, while energy sector tax expenditures also averaged roughly $4 billion per year over that same period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope divides federal support of the energy sector into four categories: direct expenditures (grants and contracts), tax expenditures, risk transfers (mostly loans and loan guarantees) and regulations. Each of these categories is summarized below. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"charts right\" style=\"width: 343px;\">\r\n<h5>Figure 2: Energy Sector Non-competed <br/>Contracts FY2000-2009</h5>\r\n<img src=\"/media/images/energy/energy_summary_contracts.png\"/><br/>\r\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of data from <br/> USAspending.gov.

Subsidyscope deems all of these programs as likely to contain a subsidy, and therefore includes all of them in our analysis. The largest grant program in the energy sector is DOE\u2019s Weatherization Assistance for Low Income Persons (WAP). The program received $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2009, $5.4 billion more than the year before. All of this increase came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a>  <a href=\"/energy/direct-expenditures/search/\">Click here</a> to search Subsidyscope\u2019s database of energy-related grants.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The government spent another $4.3 billion on non-competed contracts for energy-related goods or services. Subsidyscope considers non-competed contracts as more likely to contain a subsidy component than competed contracts. <a href=\"/energy/contracts/search/\">Click here</a> to search Subsidyscope\u2019s database of energy-related non-competed contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"charts right\"  style=\"width: 343px; margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 25px;\">\r\n<h5>Figure 3: Energy Sector <br/>\r\nTax Expenditures FY2009</h5>\r\n<img src=\"/media/images/energy/energy_summary_te.png\"/><br/>\r\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of Analytical Perspectives. OMB. Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2011. p. 209.</cite>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tax Expenditures </h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The energy sector claimed about $6.3 billion in federal tax credits and deductions in fiscal year 2009. That figure does not include broad-based tax provisions, such as accelerated depreciation of machinery and equipment, which benefited firms across the entire economy. The largest tax break for energy companies allows them to expense their exploration and development costs for oil, a provision that cost the Treasury about $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, federal tax policy has subsidized fossil fuels to a greater extent than renewable energy sources or conservation. Over the next five years, however, federal tax policy is likely to provide greater support to renewable and alternative fuels than to any other category. For more on tax expenditures in the energy sector, see <a href=\"/energy/tax-expenditures/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"charts left\" style=\"width: 343px; margin-right: 15px;\">\r\n<h5>Figure 4: Energy Sector<br/>\r\nRisk Transfers FY2009</h5>\r\n<img src=\"/media/images/energy/energy_summary_rt.png\"/><br/>\r\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of data from the Federal Credit Supplement. OMB. Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2010. Tables 1 and 2.</cite>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risk Transfers</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government also subsidizes the energy sector with loans and loan guarantees, assuming financial risks that otherwise would be borne by investors or other entities. These \"risk transfers\" totaled $31.2 billion in fiscal year 2009 -- $16.7 billion in direct loans to companies and $14.5 billion in loan guarantees. Prior to 2009, direct loan programs in the energy sector focused primarily on improving electricity transmission in rural areas, while loan guarantee programs focused on both electricity transmission and renewable energy.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a>  In fiscal year 2009, the largest direct-loan program was DOE\u2019s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, and the largest loan guarantee initiative was DOE\u2019s Innovative Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy and Advanced Transmission and Distribution Technologies Program. See Subsidyscope's <a href=\"/energy/risk-transfers/\">risk transfers page</a> for more details on these and other loan and loan guarantee programs. </p>\r\n\r\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: -10px;\">Regulations</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government subsidizes the energy sector through regulations, which can significantly benefit particular producers or consumers. Unfortunately, there is no way to methodically identify and quantify these subsidies.  Subsidyscope's <a href=\"/energy/regulations/\">regulations page</a> describes some of the regulatory subsidies in the energy sector, such as royalty relief for the oil and gas industry. Other regulatory subsidies in the energy sector include the renewable fuels standard (RFS), and environmental response cleanup.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Structure of Sector</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the pages above, Subsidyscope examines the size and scope of the energy sector and explains the economic rationale for government intervention <a href=\"/energy/overview/structure/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Limitations of Government Data</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As with other sectors, Subsidyscope relies solely on government figures to estimate subsidies and spending on programs that are likely to contain a subsidy. Subsidyscope recognizes that government data can be of poor quality and in particular may not include some types of subsidies.  The data may also contain gaps that prevent allocating published subsidy data to recipient sectors.  All of these limitations can result in omissions of federal support that may, nonetheless, influence markets.  Subsidyscope presents examples of these limitations with respect to energy in <a href=\"/energy/summary/data-limitations/\">this table</a>.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>An important objective of the Subsidyscope initiative is to help identify such gaps and other data problems so that, over time, they can be addressed and estimates of subsidies and subsidy spending will continually improve. For instance, Subsidyscope is in the process of acquiring additional information from Treasury which, we hope, will allow a credible apportionment of some tax expenditures across economic sectors that, at present, are available only economy-wide.  With this in mind, we will continue to evaluate the energy sector and identify data gaps and needs that would result in a more accurate estimate of subsidies and subsidy spending and post this assessment on this site.

Subsidyscope\u2019s review of federal data shows that in fiscal year 2008 about $6.6 billion was directly loaned to companies and other organizations in the energy sector. Also, the government committed to guarantee nearly $785 million in additional loans in the sector. In fiscal year 2009, those numbers significantly increased, with direct loans adding up to $16.7 billion and commitments to guarantee third party loans totaling $14.5 billion. Subsidy estimates produced by the government for these loans and loan guarantees are presented below where available. While subsidy rates are often presented for specific programs, actual subsidy dollar amounts were not provided by the federal agencies administering the energy loan and loan guarantees shown below. Therefore, Subsidyscope does not present an aggregate total for the subsidy provided. Further, due to omissions and other potential errors in federal data, these numbers should be used with caution.<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a> </p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope refers to these methods of providing subsidies (e.g., loans) as \"risk transfers.\" By transferring risk from others to itself, the federal government encourages people to undertake activities they may not otherwise carry out. Such risk transfers are typically accomplished through government credit and insurance programs, such as the student loan program and federal deposit insurance. The extent of a subsidy received under a credit or insurance program generally is the difference between the terms the recipient would get in a competitive market and those offered by the government. (See Subsidyscope's discussion <a href=\"/loans/\">here</a> for more detail on federal credit and insurance programs.) </p>\n\n<p>Under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 the government is required to estimate the expected cost to the government of loan and loan guarantee programs. While these estimates have limitations,<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a>  the government essentially attempts to predict the net cost of a loan or loan guarantee by totaling up all the expected future cash flows to and from the government.  A positive net flow from the government indicates there is a net cost to the government and that a subsidy is being provided to the borrower. The \"subsidy rate\" is the net cost (in current dollars) to the government divided by the total loan volume of the program; this rate approximates the percentage of the loan disbursements that the government is expected to lose after the expected return on the investment is taken into account.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a>  </p>\n\n<p>In the energy sector, there are several main programs through which the government takes on risk. The largest programs are carried out by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the innovative technology and renewable energy loan guarantee programs, which were significantly ramped up as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Another large program is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Utility Service, which makes loans and loan guarantees for generating and distributing electricity. In addition, the DOE provides lending and loan guarantees for nuclear power facilities.  Prior to 2009, the majority of the direct loans in the energy sector were administered through the USDA for the purpose of improving electricity transmission in rural areas.  Loan guarantees were also primarily administered through the USDA, with programs focusing on both electricity transmission and renewable energy production. These and other programs are described in more detail below. </p>\n\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n<h5>Table 1: Loans in the Energy Sector Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009</h5>\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"header-row\">\n  <td>Program</td>\n  <td>Agency</td>\n  <td>2008 Subsidy<br/>Rate %</td>\n  <td>2008 Obligations<br/>\n($ millions)</td>\n  <td>2009 Subsidy<br/>Rate %</td>\n  <td>2009 Obligations<br/>\n($ millions)</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program\">Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing</td><td>DOE</td><td></td><td></td><td>21.74</td><td>10,100</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"program\">Rural Electrification and Telephone Program:<br/> FFB Electric Loans</td><td>USDA</td><td>-0.70</td><td>6,500</td><td>-2.28</td><td>6,500</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program\">Rural Electrification and Telephone Program:<br/>Electric Hardship Loans</td><td>USDA</td><td>0.12</td><td>99</td><td>-2.38</td><td>100</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"program\">Energy Retrofit Loans</td><td>HUD</td><td></td><td></td><td>89.92</td><td>92</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"total\"><td class=\"program\">Total</td><td></td><td></td><td>6,599</td><td></td><td>16,792</td></tr>\n\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<cite>\nSource: Subsidyscope analysis of data from the Federal Credit Supplement (FCS). 2008 numbers are from the <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy09/cr_supp.html\">FCS FY2009</a>, Table 1.; 2009 numbers are from the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/cr_supp.pdf\">FCS FY2010</a>, Table 1.<br/>                                                     \nNote:  Credit programs may report \"negative\" subsidies under the accounting and valuation rules specified in the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.  A negative subsidy occurs when the estimated cost to the government of providing credit is less than the estimated income from repayments, interest and fees.  The cost to the government is in part determined by the estimated risk of default.  Most frequently, negative subsidies result from the use of a risk free discount rate to value risky future cash flows. This has the effect of overvaluing expected income to the government from loans and guarantees and undervaluing the government\u2019s expected costs from defaults. See <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/48xx/doc4857/11-24-FHA.pdf#page2\">this CBO report</a> for additional information. <br/>\nFFB=Federal Financing Bank\n\n</cite>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h4>Loans</h4>\n\n<p>In fiscal year 2009, the energy sector loan program with the largest estimated loan obligations was the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVMLP), authorized in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. This program includes both grants and loans (only the loan obligations are presented here), and supports the development of advanced technology vehicles in the United States. Estimated obligations of over $10 billion in fiscal year 2009 are intended to promote technology that will increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a>  For a vehicle to fit the definition of an advanced technology vehicle, \"it must have at least 125 percent of the average base year combined fuel economy for vehicles with 'substantially similar attributes.'\"<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a>  A list of conditional commitments made through the program can be found on the DOE's <a href=\"http://www.atvmloan.energy.gov/c-commit.html\">ATVMLP Web page</a>. As of September 2010, the ATVMLP has made a total of $8.6 billion in conditional commitments to companies.</p>\n\n<p>The second and third largest loan programs in the energy sector in fiscal year 2009 are through the USDA's Rural Electrification and Telephone Program (yet these are the smallest in terms of the subsidy rate). The Federal Financing Bank (FFB) Electric Loans Program made loan obligations of $6.5 billion in fiscal year 2009, and the Electric Hardship Loans Program made loan obligations of $100 million in fiscal year 2009. According to USDA, eligible loan recipients for both programs include \"corporations, states, territories, and subdivisions and agencies thereof, municipalities, people's utility districts, and cooperative, nonprofit, limited-dividend or mutual associations that provide retail or power supply service needs in rural areas.\" <a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a></p>\n\n<p>Another relatively large energy-related loan program authorized in the ARRA provides grants and loans for sustainable or \"green\" retrofitting for multifamily housing units.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a> The Energy Retrofit Loans Program is implemented by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) which notes that this funding will be invested in energy efficient modernization and renovation of HUD-sponsored housing for low-income, elderly and disabled persons.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a> In fiscal year 2009, $92 million in loans were obligated through this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n<h5>Table 2: Loan Guarantees in the Energy Sector Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009</h5>\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"header-row\">\n  <td>Program</td>\n  <td>Agency</td>\n  <td>2008 Subsidy<br/>Rate %</td>\n  <td>2008 Commitments<br/>\n($ millions)</td>\n  <td>2009 Subsidy<br/>Rate %</td>\n  <td>2009 Commitments<br/>\n($ millions)</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program\">Title 17 Innovative Program:<br/> Section 1705 FFB Loans </td><td>DOE</td><td></td><td></td><td>11.81</td><td>8,000</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"program\">Title 17 Innovative Program:<br/>Section 1703 FFB Loans</td><td>DOE</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.00</td><td>6,000</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program\">Renewable Energy Loan Guarantees</td><td>USDA</td><td>9.69</td><td>184</td><td>9.69</td><td>312</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"program\">Section 9003 Loan Guarantees<br/>\n(Biorefinery Assistance)</td><td>USDA</td><td></td><td></td><td>33.34</td><td>225</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program\">Title 17 Innovative Technology<br/>    \nLoan Guarantees</td><td>DOE</td><td></td><td>600</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n\n<tr class=\"total\"><td class=\"program\">Total</td><td></td><td></td><td>784</td><td></td><td>14,537</td></tr>\n\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<cite>\n\nSource: Subsidyscope analysis of data from the Federal Credit Supplement (FCS). 2008 numbers are from the <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy09/cr_supp.html\">FCS FY2009</a>, Tables 1 and 2.; 2009 numbers are from the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/cr_supp.pdf\">FCS FY2010</a>, Tables 1 and 2.<br/>\nNote: The two programs entitled 'Title 17 Innovative Program: Section 1705 FFB Loans' and 'Title 17 Innovative Program: Section 1703 FFB Loans' were categorized as direct loans in the FY2010 Federal Credit Supplement.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created the Section 1703 program to support projects whose high technology risks make it difficult to obtain private financing.<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a> Eligible projects include renewable energy systems, electric power transmission systems and biofuel projects with a technology pilot project component.<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a></p>\n\n<p>The ARRA authorized a temporary provision under Section 1705 of the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/oust/fedlaws/publ_109-058.pdf\">Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT)</a> in order to support projects similar to those in Section 1703. According to the DOE, Section 1703 loan guarantees require the borrower to pay for the subsidy costs, while the new authorization under 1705 holds that the subsidy costs are provided by the government.<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a> The projected commitments for these programs presented in the President's Budget for <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy10/index.html\">fiscal year 2010</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/index.html\">fiscal year 2011</a> show continuing increases in loan guarantees.</p>\n\n<p>The DOE also uses authority granted in EPACT to guarantee loans for nuclear facilities in an effort to expand the use of nuclear electric power in the United States. The Federal Credit Supplement does not identify which guarantees are for nuclear power plants; however, the President's Budget for fiscal year 2011 proposes an additional $36 billion in loan guarantee authority be made available for nuclear power facility projects.<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a></p>\n\n<h4>The Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act</h4>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00002210----000-.html\">Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act (Price-Anderson Act)</a> limits the financial liability of companies licensed to operate nuclear power plants. Specifically, nuclear power plant licensees are required to pay an insurance premium every year for $300 million of coverage per nuclear reactor unit. In the event a nuclear accident results in offsite damages of more than $300 million per reactor, each licensee is responsible for additional coverage of up to, but no more than, approximately $96 million per reactor unit. Licensees are not responsible for damages over this amount.  The cap includes not only accidents that may happen during the operation of a reactor but also any mishap (including theft or sabotage) that may happen during the transport or storage of nuclear fuel or waste to or from the reactor. The purpose of the Price-Anderson Act is to establish a process for compensating the public for damages in the event of a nuclear accident and encourage private investment in nuclear power.</p>\n\n<p>While the liability limit has never been exceeded,<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a> in 2007 the Energy Information Administration concluded that the Price-Anderson Act \"reduces the cost of insurance to the owners of nuclear power plants . . . and, hence, reduces the cost of nuclear power and other nuclear activities.\"<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a> While estimates of this subsidy vary widely, in 2008 the Congressional Budget Office concluded that the subsidy is probably less than one percent of the cost for new nuclear generating capacity or about $600,000 per reactor.<a href=\"#footnote-16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a> As of the date of this estimate there were 104 commercial nuclear power reactors in the United States, resulting in an implied total subsidy of approximately $62 million.<a href=\"#footnote-17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a></p>\n\n<h4>The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund</h4>\n\n<p>The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990 established that the owner or operator of a facility responsible for an oil spill is also responsible for the associated damages, up to the limit of their liability.<a href=\"#footnote-18\" class=\"footnote\">18</a> The limit on damages is determined by the circumstances of the spill. For example, onshore facilities are liable for up to $350 million per spill, while holders of leases or permits for offshore facilities (such as the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig leased by BP) are liable for damages of up to $75 million per spill (not including removal costs).<a href=\"#footnote-19\" class=\"footnote\">19</a> If an oil spill is found to be the result of gross negligence, the responsible party is no longer entitled to a liability limit.<a href=\"#footnote-20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a></p>\n\n<p>The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) was created by the OPA to help the federal government rapidly and effectively manage the response to oil spills.<a href=\"#footnote-21\" class=\"footnote\">21</a> The primary purpose of the Fund is to provide the initial payment for the cleanup costs and damages resulting from oil spills, in the event that the party responsible for the spill is unknown or is unable to effectively respond to the spill.<a href=\"#footnote-22\" class=\"footnote\">22</a> Importantly, the OSLTF also pays for economic damages when the liability limit on a specific incident is reached (subject to the caps described below). In instances where the responsible party is known, the National Pollution Funds Center (under the Coast Guard) which administers the program, will later bill the costs of the cleanup and damages (up to the liability limit) to the responsible party.<a href=\"#footnote-23\" class=\"footnote\">23</a> The total amount of OSLTF funds available for a single incident is generally capped at $1 billion, with a cap of $500 million applying specifically to the payment of claims for damages to natural resources.<a href=\"#footnote-24\" class=\"footnote\">24</a></p>\n\n<p>The OSLTF is financed primarily through a tax on oil produced in or imported to the U.S., as well as through fines, penalties and cleanup costs recovered from liable parties.<a href=\"#footnote-25\" class=\"footnote\">25</a> To the extent that the OSLTF is financed by revenue from the energy sector, the cleanup costs, damages and other costs paid out of the OLTSF do not constitute a subsidy to the energy sector. It is not clear how an oil spill response would be funded in the event that the costs reach the OSLTF's $1 billion maximum for a single incident.<a href=\"#footnote-26\" class=\"footnote\">26</a> </p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"/energy/summary/\">Summary of Energy Sector</a> | <a href=\"/energy/summary/structure/\">Structure of Energy Sector</a> |  <a href=\"/energy/direct-expenditures/\">Direct Expenditures</a> |  <a href=\"/energy/tax-expenditures/\">Tax Expenditures</a> | <a href=\"/energy/regulations/\">Regulations</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Last updated September 9, 2010.</em></p>\n\n\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>See our <a href=\"http://subsidyscope.com/data-quality/\">page on data quality</a> for a description of some of the errors Subsidyscope has found in federal data.</li>\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>Congressional Budget Office (CBO). \"<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/57xx/doc5751/08-19-CreditSubsidies.pdf\">Estimating the Value of Subsidies for Federal Loans and Loan Guarantees</a>.\" August 2004. pp. 1-2.</li>\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-3\"></a>For more on the calculation of subsidy rates see: CBO. \"<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/68xx/doc6874/11-16-StudentLoans.pdf\">Subsidy Estimates for Direct and Guaranteed Student Loans</a>.\" November 2005, Box 2, p. 10.</li>\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-4\"></a>Office of Management of Budget (OMB). \"<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/cr_supp.pdf\">Federal Credit Supplement FY2010</a>.\" Table 1.

Tax expenditures have the same effect on the federal budget as government spending.  They can have effects on recipients similar to grants or other types of subsidies.  For instance, if the government wants to encourage people to buy solar panels for their homes, it can either send checks to those who promise to buy the panels or offer tax breaks once the panels have been purchased.</p>\n\n\n<p>Tax expenditures can affect more than just the targeted activity.  When certain people or organizations are selected to receive targeted tax breaks through tax subsidies, the size of the tax base is reduced and tax rates then have to be increased for everyone in order to bring in an equivalent amount of revenue to the pre-tax expenditure level.  Further, if a tax subsidy is not expressly intended to make a tax more efficient, then it will most likely produce an economic inefficiency.  For example, when a tax subsidy is given to businesses to invest in a specific commodity, private investment is shifted from some other commodity into the tax-preferred area of investment without regard to the return on investment.  This creates an economic inefficiency. Tax subsidies can also end up rewarding taxpayers for behavior they would have engaged in regardless of the tax benefit.</p>\n\n<p>Because the federal income tax is a progressive tax and those with higher incomes pay a higher proportion in taxes, the value of a tax subsidy grows as income rises, reducing progressivity. This has led some to call tax expenditures \"upside down subsidies,\" since they tend to generally benefit those with higher incomes more than those with lower incomes in a progressive income tax system.</p>\n\n<p>Not only do tax subsidies benefit a small group of interests \u2014 often those with higher incomes \u2014 they usually do not go through open, transparent political processes. Particularly true in the case of tax subsidies, expenditures through the revenue code are often large, hidden, and not subject to the same public debate as direct spending. Further, they do not get evaluated like much direct government spending does. Politicians often employ tax expenditures because they can use the tax code to confer benefits to constituents while campaigning on a platform of lowering taxes, which sounds quite a bit different than explaining that they use the tax code to benefit certain people and not others.</p>\n\n<p>There are experts who disagree on what baseline should be used to measure tax expenditures.  Some assume that the current tax system is, or should be, a broad-based income tax.  Others argue it is, or should be, a consumption tax.  The baseline one uses can greatly change what gets counted.  For instance, using an income tax baseline, the exemption for investment income from Individual Retirement Accounts would be considered a tax expenditure.  Using the consumption tax baseline, this provision would not be counted as a tax expenditure since income from investments is not subject to a consumption tax.</p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope does not take a position on which tax structure is appropriate but presents tax expenditures estimates based on the income tax baseline because the Department of the Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) use this baseline in making their estimates.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are still differences between the estimates produced by the JCT and the Treasury even though the same income tax baseline is used. As the JCT explains in a recent document entitled \"<a href=\"http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=1196\">A Reconsideration of Tax Expenditure Analysis</a>,\" the Treasury's analysis has changed over time. It has shifted from the use of a \"normal\" to a \"reference\" baseline, as the tax starting point from which to measure income tax expenditures. A \"normal\" baseline is considered more theoretical in nature, and based on the economic notion of a comprehensive income tax that applies to all income, which we have never had in practice as some types of income are excluded from taxation. Alternatively, a \"reference\" baseline more closely matches the actual tax code that we have, and considers some of the deviations from a normal income tax as part of the baseline rather than counting them as tax expenditures.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>Illustrating the dynamic nature of this debate, the JCT proposed in 2008 to move away from the use of a \"normal\" income tax baseline toward the use of a \"reference\" baseline. This would incorporate current codified tax law and would more closely resemble Treasury's model, rather than comparing current law to some theoretical and heretofore undefined in practical use, \"normal\" baseline. JCT asserts that this revised approach will result in a more principled and neutral approach to the issues.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this information, Subsidyscope will present the Treasury's estimates, which are compiled annually by the Office of Management and Budget in the <i>Analytical Perspectives</i> of the President's Budget. Those interested in the JCT estimates may find them <a href=\"http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=1192\">here</a>; for the transportation sector, the estimates are very similar.</p>", "locked": 0, "page": 94, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 167, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<h5>Risk Transfers: <span>Loans, Loan Guarantees</span> and Insurance</h5>\n\n<p>The federal government uses subsidies to redirect resources and influence economic decisions. One method of subsidization is transferring some or all of the financial risk of an economic activity to the federal government.  By reducing risk, the federal government encourages more people to undertake an activity.  Such risk transfers are typically done through government credit programs, such as student loans, and insurance, such as federal deposit insurance.</p>\n\n<p>The extent of a subsidy received under a credit or insurance program is generally the difference between the terms the recipient would get in a competitive market and those offered by the government. Click the links below for more detail on Federal credit and insurance programs.</p>\n\n<style>.bla {border-bottom: 1px solid #99b1c2; padding: 4px;}.bla a {padding:5px;text-decoration: none !important;}</style>\n<span class=\"bla\"><a href=\"#loanguarantees\">Loans & Loan Guarantees</a> | <a href=\"#insurance\">Insurance</a> | <a href=\"#financialrisk\">Insurance against Financial Risk</a> | <a href=\"#naturaldisaster\">Insurance Against Natural Disaster</a> | <a href=\"#securityrelated\">Insurance Against Security-Related\nRisks</a></span>\n<p>\n\n\n<a name=\"loanguarantees\"><h5>Loans and Loan Guarantees</h5></a>\n<p>In the case of direct loans, the government lends money directly to the borrower and services the loan by collecting repayments. When the government offers direct loans at below market interest rates, or terms more generous than what private markets would provide, there is a subsidy. Credit subsidies may also be provided when the government pays some of the interest or offers a grace period before the loan goes into repayment. Further subsidies may result from lower administrative fees than would normally be required by private lenders. For example, many student loans provide a subsidy to the borrower because they have lower interest rates than a standard loan. In some cases the government also pays for the interest on the loans while the borrower remains in school.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of a government loan guarantee, a private lender disburses the loan to the borrower, and the government acts as the guarantor of the loan by agreeing to make payments should the borrower fail to do so. Such a guarantee often allows a borrower to secure a loan at a lower interest rate than it could otherwise obtain.  Even if the interest rate is a market rate and the loan is repaid in full there may be a subsidy if the borrower did not pay an upfront fee for the guarantee, as they would from a private lender. In addition, a government guarantee encourages lenders to offer loans to borrowers to whom they might otherwise not \nextend credit. </p>\n\n<p>The way that the federal government accounts for the costs of federal credit, including the associated subsidies, has changed over time.  A significant shift occurred with the <a href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/02C17A.txt\">Federal Credit Reform \nAct of 1990</a>, which requires that the government use an accrual basis rather than a cash basis to budget for loans, with the main difference being the timing of the recognition of the government's loss on the transaction. This change means that an estimate of the net present value of the expected loss on the loan is accounted for in the budget when the loan is disbursed. While a big step toward increasing transparency, the 1990 change has some shortcomings. As the Congressional Budget Office explains in a 2004 report \"<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/57xx/doc5751/08-19-CreditSubsidies.pdf\">Estimating the Value of Subsidies for Federal Loans and Loan Guarantees</a>,\" the government underestimates the subsidy amount of loans and loan guarantees.  This lower estimate \nresults from two omissions: first the government does not include the cost of administering the loan (though this is accounted for elsewhere in the budget, it is not included in the subsidy cost of the credit); and second, the government &mdash; using methods required under credit reform &mdash; does not include the cost of market risk when calculating net present value. This risk is included in the cost of private market loans. These exclusions systematically understate the cost of loans and loan guarantees to the government. (For more on calculating subsidies under credit reform, see this <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/57xx/doc5751/08-19-CreditSubsidies.pdf\">report</a>.) </p>\n\n<p>Over the years the government's involvement in direct loans has remained fairly steady while it has become the guarantor of an increasing number of loans.  <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">According to the Office of Management and Budget in the President's Budget for fiscal year 2010</a>, the federal government had $286 billion outstanding in direct loans in 2008. In the same year, there were $1.4 trillion in government guaranteed loans on the budget. This makes the total outstanding federal credit $1.693 trillion. The largest category of both direct loans and loan guarantees is student loans, at $148 billion in direct loans and $415 billion in guaranteed student loans in 2008. Guarantees for home mortgage loans also make up a significant portion of government guaranteed loans. <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">OMB estimates</a> that the cost to the government of outstanding guaranteed loans through the Federal Housing Administration's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund in 2008 will be $448 billion.</p>\n\n<a name=\"insurance\"><h5>Insurance</h5></a>\n<p>The federal government operates a number of insurance programs.  These include insurance of bank deposits against financial loss through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; insurance of defined benefit pension plans through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; insurance against natural disasters,such as crop insurance and flood insurance; and insurance against security-related risks, such as war time insurance.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>Government insurance programs often provide a subsidy to beneficiaries. When lower than actuarially fair premiums are charged, a subsidy is provided to the insured. A key characteristic of government insurance programs is their lack of visibility in the federal budget. Insurance programs expose the government to trillions of dollars of contingent liability, yet these potential claims on taxpayers are not reported in the federal budget unless losses occur.<sup>2</sup> For this reason it is difficult to obtain data on government insurance programs and the subsidies they provide.</p>\n\n<p>Insurance programs are reported in the budget on a cash basis. They look like moneymakers for the government in most years because the premiums paid in good times outweigh the claims paid, even if future claims after a bad event swamp the premiums paid.  Insurance programs also appear to be self-financing and less dependent on taxes, even though future claims may burden taxpayers. Further, they often target a relatively small group (such as farmers). For these reasons, indirect subsidies through insurance programs are politically appealing because politicians can take credit for visibly supporting specific constituents while also claiming that they are not spending taxpayer dollars.</p>\n\n<p>The following sections look more closely at three categories of federal insurance: insurance against financial risk, insurance against natural disasters, and insurance against national security related risks. </p>\n\n<a name=\"financialrisk\"><h5>Insurance  Against Financial Risk</h5></a>\n  \n<p>Before the financial bailout of 2008, two insurance programs in the financial sector &mdash; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) &mdash; were responsible for most of the trillions of dollars of government insurance exposure. Through the FDIC, the federal government insures depositors against the failure of banks up to $250,000<sup>2</sup> per depositor. When an institution fails, a charge is made against the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is supported by fees imposed on the banking industry. The fund is also supported by a backstop line of credit from the U.S. Treasury that could be tapped if the fees were insufficient to cover losses. <a href=\"http://www.subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/fdic/bank-failures/\">A rash of bank failures</a> caused the fund's balance to drop from about $52 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 to about $13 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2009.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government also insures against the insolvency of firms with underfunded pension plans to pay out promised pension benefits (defined-benefits plans) through the PBGC. The largest 10 claims against the PBGC's single employer program from 1975 to 2007 <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">totaled $32.6 billion</a>. Nine of these 10 claims came after 2001; leaving the program at a $10.7 billion deficit in 2008 as compared to a $9.7 billion surplus at the end of 2000. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to increasing the amount insured under federal deposit insurance, the government's response to the financial crisis included actions such as extending credit, guaranteeing more debt and assets and purchasing a number of mortgage-backed securities \nheld by government sponsored enterprises.  See these Subsidyscope posts for more on the recent activities of the <a href=\"/projects/bailout/federal-reserve/\">Federal Reserve</a>, <a href=\"/projects/bailout/treasury/\">the Treasury</a>, <a href=\"/projects/bailout/fdic/bank-failures/\">the FDIC</a> and <a href=\"/projects/bailout/fhlb/\">Federal Home Loan Banks</a>.</p>\n\n<a name=\"naturaldisaster\"><h5>Insurance Against Natural Disasters </h5></a>\n\n<p>In order to insure against natural disasters, the government provides two main insurance programs &mdash; crop insurance and flood insurance. Crop insurance, administered by the US Department of Agriculture in conjunction with the private insurance industry, protects farmers against low yields and crop quality that may result from bad weather or insect damage. Flood insurance, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency within the Department of Homeland Security, provides insurance \"<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">to homeowners and businesses in communities that have adopted and enforced appropriate flood plain measures</a>.\" At the end of 2008, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">OMB reports</a> that 5.6 million policies collectively worth more than $1 trillion were in force in more than 20,200 communities. While disaster insurance programs can be large, on the whole they are smaller than insurance against financial insolvency. </p>\n\n<a name=\"securityrelated\"><h5>Insurance Against Security-Related Risks </h5></a>\n\n<p>The federal government offers several types of insurance against acts of war and terrorism, including terrorism risk insurance, aviation war risk insurance, and maritime war risk insurance. Terrorism risk insurance &mdash; enacted in 2002 in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks &mdash; was set up as a temporary program to support the insurance industry. The budget includes estimates of the cost of the terrorism risk insurance; however, this does not represent the potential costs were there to be  future attacks. The extension of the legislation &mdash; <a href=\"http://treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/financial-institution/terrorism-insurance/\">the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act</a> &mdash; in 2007 is slated to sunset in 2014. Reflecting this extension, the insurance <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">is forecasted</a> to cost taxpayers $2.16 billion from 2009 &mdash; 2014, and $3.069 billion from 2009 &ndash; 2018 (spending less receipts from premium surcharges). The <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\"><i>Analytical Perspectives</i></a> of the President's Budget for fiscal year 2010 states that the \"Administration proposes to lessen Federal intervention in this insurance market and reduce the subsidy to private insurers\" (i.e., increase the private sector's share of losses). </p>\n\n<p>Many airlines hold insurance policies against catastrophic events such as war or terrorism. After the September 11, 2001, attacks, third party liability war risk coverage that airlines carried through private insurers was canceled, and the cost of other war risk insurance coverage dramatically increased. As one of the many government responses, the Secretary of Homeland Security was required \"<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">to provide additional war risk insurance coverage for hull losses and passenger liability to air carriers insured for third-party war risk liability as of June 29, 2002</a>.\" The Federal Aviation Administration has made such insurance coverage available; further, the Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to limit an air carrier's third party liability to $100 million when loss stems from terrorism. Many airlines could be grounded without such coverage. </p>\n\n<p>Backing these policies is the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund of the Department of Transportation. This fund currently insures 62 air carries for between $80 million to $4 billion per carrier (median insurance is $1.8 billion). The fund contains $1.15 billion in premiums paid in as of the end of 2008, which <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/spec.pdf\">the Office of Management and Budget states</a> would be insufficient to \"meet either the coverage limits of the largest policies in force ($4 billion) or to meet a series of large claims in succession.\" The federal government would be on the hook \nfor any outstanding claims in the fund.</p>\n\n<p>The government also offers a <a href=\"{% url transportation-cfda-programpage-by-programnumber 20.803 %}\">maritime war risk insurance</a> program that makes insurance available to commercial ships during wartime. <a href=\"http://www.marad.dot.gov/about_us_landing_page/budget_information/Budget_In_Brief.htm\">According to the Department of Transportation</a>, the program, along with other Maritime Administration initiatives, \"assures [Department of Defense] access to U.S.-flag commercial ships and crews during DOD mobilizations, and helps ensure the efficient flow of military cargo through commercial ports.\"</p>\n\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\n<li>Social Security is often called \"Social\" Insurance, but its key features sufficiently distinguish it from the other insurance programs considered here.</li>\n<li>The current level of $250,000 is a temporary increase through December 2009; it was raised from $100,000 in October 2008. Pending legislation would make the increase permanent beyond 2009.</li></ol>", "locked": 0, "page": 95, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 166, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p>The federal government relies on contracts to supply a wide range of goods and services.  Contracts differ from other direct expenditures, such as grants, because the government directly benefits from fulfillment of the contract.  For example, the government would use a contract to build housing for U.S. troops but might use a grant to build a homeless shelter.  The U.S. government directly benefits when the troops are sheltered, but, no matter how desirable, does not directly benefit from the homeless being sheltered.</p>\n\n<p>Under a contract, a subsidy generally occurs when the government pays more than fair market value for a good or service. Subsidies may also be provided to companies that have a preferred status in the bidding process. Government contracts have long been used as a method for subsidizing certain activities the government encourages.  For instance, in the 1840s the government wanted to support the development of oceangoing steamships, a relatively new technology at the time.  This resulted in Congress offering padded Post Office contracts to shipping companies if they used steamships to deliver the mail.</p>\n\n<p>More often than not, however, a government contract is just a government contract and it does not have a subsidy component.  In some cases it is clear that a contract does include a subsidy component.  For example, federal procurement rules explicitly favor certain types of businesses, such as minority-owned businesses and certain types of goods, such as recycled paper. But in many cases it is difficult to determine when a subsidy is taking place since the fair market value may be a matter of opinion.  For example, as part of a trade dispute, the European Union claims Boeing, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, is receiving subsidies through \"overpriced DoD contracts.\"<sup>1</sup>  Boeing argues the \"payments represent the value of those services [rendered to the government].  They are not subsidies.\"<sup>2</sup>  It may be difficult to prove either side is correct.</p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope does not attempt to determine which contracts have a subsidy component or measure what that component may be.  We do presume, however, that competed contracts \u2013 contracts that are subject to an open bidding process &mdash; generally do not have a large subsidy component, even though the bidding process may include certain preferences.  Thus, we focus on those contracts that are not competed and make this information available to the public.  This does not mean non-competed contracts contain a significant subsidy, only that they are more likely to do so.</p>\n\n<h4>About FPDS</h4>\n\n<p>The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) tracks information about contractual purchases of goods and services made by the federal government.  It is a vast and comprehensive system, but in some ways is less relevant to Subsidyscope's mission than the data in <a href=\"{% url about-faads %}\">Federal Award and Assistance Data Set</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Not every record in FPDS represents a subsidy.  In many cases the records simply detail a government purchase of a good or service at the prevailing market price.  Subsidyscope's advisory board agreed that it would be a mistake to classify such spending as subsidies to private industry.  Instead, we focus on contracts that were not subjected to a fully open competitive bidding process.  There are often good reasons for eschewing the competition process, which can be inefficient and time-consuming.  But in some cases competition is avoided in order to provide a benefit to a specific bidder or class of bidders (e.g. an incumbent vendor; vendors owned members of historically disadvantaged groups).  Although it is not possible to state whether a subsidy is present without a record-by-record analysis of each contract, most of the subsidies that have been intentionally inserted into the contracting process will be represented within the subset of contracts that were not fully competed.</p>\n\n<p>A further complication arises when assigning FPDS transactions to a sector.  Although the expenditures made under a direct assistance program like those in FAADS typically have a narrow set of purposes and recipient types, an agency may procure a wide variety of products in the course of fulfilling its mandate, from office supplies to software to raw materials &mdash; a catering charge incurred by the Department of Transportation cannot be reasonably claimed to be a subsidy to the transportation sector. For this reason we have based our analysis on two pieces of data that are available to each FPDS record. When possible we use each record's <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/\">North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)</a> code, a standard for identifying industrial activity that is often included during the bidding process for a government contract.  Unfortunately, not every record in FPDS contains a NAICS code. In these cases we use the <a href=\"http://www.fpdsng.com/downloads/service_product_codes.pdf\">Product/Service Code (PSC)</a> (PDF) to identify the appropriate sector for each record.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"http://www.eurunion.org/news/press/2004/200400137.htm\">http://www.eurunion.org/news/press/2004/200400137.htm</a></li>\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-2\" href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2007-03-23-eu-boeing-subsidy-ap_N.htm\">http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2007-03-23-eu-boeing-subsidy-ap_N.htm</a></li>\n</ol>", "locked": 0, "page": 93, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 165, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p>The federal government uses direct expenditures to implement many programs.

However, measuring the subsidies delivered through direct expenditure programs can be quite hard.  Not all government programs contain a subsidy.

Of this total, federal funds,<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a>  which can be applied toward \u201cfederal-aid eligible\u201d roads such as interstates, U.S. highways and major state and local routes, accounted for only $36 billion (19 percent).<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a>  The remaining portion came from a combination of state and local sources, varying substantially between states due to budgetary and organizational differences.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope provides an interactive database (below), allowing users to explore and visualize highway funding and organizational structures by geographic region.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a> The data that drive this interface are also available for <a href=\"/media/data/transportation/state_highway_funding_summary_2007_dollars.csv\">download</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n", "locked": 0, "page": 100, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 181, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<div class=\"news_box related_updates_box\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\">\r\n\t<ul class=\"news_box_items\">\r\n             <li><strong><a href=\"{% url tax_expenditures-main %}\">Explore Pew's Tax Expenditure Database &raquo;</a></strong></li>\r\n       </li>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope presents tax expenditure estimates from both the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), as presented annually in the <em>President\u2019s Budget</em>, and the Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), as presented annually in the <em>Estimates of Federal Tax Expenditures</em>. Each number estimates the amount of revenue that the government loses due to specific provisions in the tax code, such as exemptions, credits and deductions, exclusions, preferential rates or deferrals. The estimates presented are based on tax models and do not measure actual losses from tax form submissions. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax expenditure estimates are static; each line item is estimated in isolation from the economic effects of other tax expenditures. The Treasury and JCT do not aggregate tax expenditures in their presentations of tax expenditure estimates.  However, Subsidyscope does provide aggregates based on respective Treasury or JCT line items. <em>Summing tax expenditures often provides a reasonably good estimate for the total cost of groups of tax expenditures, though it does not capture the potential interactions among tax expenditures if any single one is changed or repealed.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope compiles data across Treasury and JCT tax expenditure budgets, and across years within those budgets. The report years, presented along the vertical axis (varying down the rows), correspond to the year of the budget or document in which the estimates were obtained.  The estimate years, presented along the horizontal axis (varying across the columns), correspond to the years of estimates within a specific budget or document.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to present both the Treasury and JCT estimates for the same tax expenditure, Subsidyscope groups Treasury and JCT tax expenditures together when their definitions and budget functions match.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">1</a> In some cases, Subsidyscope makes a judgment call to match tax expenditures after researching the content of the line items. In other cases, even after researching the tax expenditures, it is unclear whether a Treasury and JCT estimate are describing the same tax expenditure. In these cases, the tax expenditures are left unmatched. The definitions used to match data can be found in the \u201cTax Expenditures\u201d chapter of the <em>Analytical Perspectives</em>, found in each of the President\u2019s Budgets (for the Treasury tax expenditures), and in the Congressional Research Service\u2019s <em>2008 Tax Expenditures: Compendium of Background Material on Individual Provisions</em> (for the JCT tax expenditures). Further, the Compendium provides detailed information on many of the tax expenditures estimated by JCT. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For presentation purposes, Subsidyscope uses Treasury\u2019s naming convention for describing tax expenditure items, and when a name changes over time, the most recent Treasury title is used. Once tax expenditures are matched, the JCT tax expenditure is listed under the most recent Treasury title. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Treasury and JCT tax expenditure line items match, but are found in different budget functions, a footnote is added to both line items to indicate where the corresponding tax expenditure can be found. Often, Treasury will use a broader definition to estimate certain tax expenditures; for example, JCT may break out specific provisions of a tax expenditure and estimate them separately, whereas Treasury will roll up each section into one total. When this occurs, and it is determined that the tax expenditures are the same, Subsidyscope presents the entire group of JCT tax expenditures next to the corresponding Treasury tax expenditure. </p>\r\n\t\r\n<p>Because Subsidyscope relies on government data, any errors or omissions in the data will be replicated in our dataset. For both Treasury and JCT, we will present footnotes as they are presented in the government documents. Where we believe footnotes are missing or incorrect, we will provide the original footnote as well as our corrections. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The JCT does not provide numerical values for positive tax expenditures of less than $50 million, or negative tax expenditures of less than $50 million.  Instead, it generally provides notation that a positive or negative tax expenditure of less than $50 million is being estimated.  Subsidyscope presents these values using an asterisk.  The asterisk does not distinguish between a positive or negative tax expenditure of less than $50 million, however, this determination is available in the downloadable CSV file.  When multiple positive or negative tax expenditures of less than $50 million are aggregated, the total value is unknown. Thus, the asterisk is presented next to aggregated values to indicate that an unknown amount should be added or subtracted from this total. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to differences in presentation, there are methodological differences in tax expenditure estimates produced by the Treasury and JCT. These differences arise due to baseline structures used to define tax expenditures. In its tax expenditure budget, the JCT lays out the differences between the Treasury and JCT methodologies, which Subsidyscope presents below. As JCT <a href=\"http://www.jct.gov/x-37-08.pdf\">describes in a supplementary report</a> on tax expenditures, Treasury's analysis has changed over time and has shifted from the use of a \"normal\" to a \"reference\" baseline, as the tax starting point from which to measure income tax expenditures. A \"normal\" baseline is considered more theoretical in nature, and based on the economic notion of a comprehensive income tax that applies to all income. Alternatively, a \"reference\" baseline more closely matches the actual tax code that we have, and considers some of the deviations from a normal income tax as part of the baseline rather than counting them as tax expenditures. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; padding: 0 25px 0 25px;\">\r\n\r\n<h4>Differences between Treasury and JCT Tax Expenditure Estimates:</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> The following text was copied from the JCT's \u201cEstimates of Federal Tax Expenditures for Fiscal Years 2009-2013.\u201d Pages 19-20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Joint Committee staff and Treasury lists of tax expenditures differ in at least six respects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the Joint Committee staff and the Treasury use differing methodologies for the estimation of  tax expenditures\u2026. Under the Joint Committee staff methodology, each tax expenditure is measured by the difference between tax liability under present law and the tax liability that would result if the tax expenditure provision were repealed and taxpayers were allowed to take advantage of any of the remaining tax expenditure provisions that apply to the income or the expenses associated with the repealed tax expenditure.  For example, the tax expenditure provision for the exclusion of employer-paid health insurance is measured by the difference between tax liability under present law and the tax liability that would result if the exclusion were repealed and taxpayers were allowed to claim the next best tax treatment for the previously excluded employer-paid health insurance. This next best tax treatment could be the inclusion of the employer-paid health insurance as an itemized medical deduction on Schedule A. <a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the Treasury methodology, each tax expenditure is measured by the difference between tax liability under present law and the tax liability that would result if the tax expenditure provision were repealed and taxpayers were prohibited from taking advantage of any of the remaining tax expenditure provisions that apply to the income or the expenses associated with the repealed tax expenditure. For example, the tax expenditure provision for the exclusion for employer-paid health insurance is measured by the difference between tax liability under present law and the tax liability that would result if the exclusion were repealed and taxpayers were required to include all of the employer-paid health insurance in income, with no offsetting deductions (i.e., no deductibility on Schedule A).</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Second, the Treasury uses a different classification of those provisions that can be considered a part of normal income tax law under both the individual and business income taxes. In general, the Joint Committee staff methodology involves a broader definition of the normal income tax base. Thus, the Joint Committee list of tax expenditures includes some provisions that are not contained in the Treasury list. The cash method of accounting by certain businesses provides an example. The Treasury considers the cash accounting option for certain businesses to be a part of normal income tax law, but the Joint Committee staff methodology treats it as a departure from normal income tax law that constitutes a tax expenditure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Third, the Joint Committee staff and the Treasury estimates of tax expenditures may also differ as a result of differing data sources and differences in baseline projections of incomes and expenses. The Treasury's tax expenditure calculations are based on the Administration's economic forecast. The Joint Committee staff calculations are based on the economic forecast prepared by the CBO.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourth, the Joint Committee staff and the Treasury estimates of tax expenditures span slightly different sets of years. The Treasury's estimates cover a seven-year period: the last fiscal year, the current fiscal year when the President's budget is submitted, and the next five fiscal years, i.e., fiscal years 2008-2014. The Joint Committee staff estimates cover a recent fiscal year and the succeeding four fiscal years, i.e., fiscal years 2009-2013.    </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fifth, the Joint Committee staff list excludes those provisions that are estimated to result in revenue losses below the <em>de minimis</em> amount, i.e., less than $50 million over the five fiscal years 2009 through 2013. The Treasury rounds all yearly estimates to the nearest $10 million and excludes those provisions with estimates that round to zero in each year, i.e., provisions that result in less than $5 million in revenue loss in each of the years 2008 through 2014.    </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the Joint Committee staff list formally integrates negative tax expenditures into its standard presentation. </p>\r\n</div>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\r\n\r\n<li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>Treasury and JCT group tax expenditures together using budget function.  The federal budget is divided into approximately 20 categories called budget functions.  These categories include all spending for a given topic, regardless of the federal agency that oversees the individual federal program.  Subsidyscope presents tax expenditures according to the budget function into which the federal government has placed them.</li>\r\n<li><a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>If the exclusion were repealed, the value of the employer-paid health insurance would be included in income and taxpayers would be treated as having purchased the insurance themselves. Thus, the insurance expense would be deductible as an itemized medical expense on Schedule A, subject to the itemized medical deduction floor (7.5 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n", "locked": 0, "page": 102, "name": "text1"}}, {"pk": 182, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<style>\n#subsidy-charts td.full { padding-left: 25px; width: 70%; }\n#subsidy-charts td.right { padding-right: 50px; text-align:right;}\n</style>\n\n<p>The housing sector is the recipient of some of the largest tax subsidies in the U.S. tax code. In fiscal year 2009, the estimated revenue lost by the federal government from housing-related tax expenditures topped $185 billion,<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a>  with the vast majority of these subsidies supporting homeownership. </p>\n\n<p>Tax expenditures are government revenue losses resulting from provisions in the tax code that allow a taxpayer or business to reduce their tax burden by taking certain deductions, exemptions, exclusions, preferential rates, deferrals or credits. Tax expenditures reduce the payment of taxes that would otherwise have been collected by the government, and thus have a similar effect on the federal budget as a grant program. They can also benefit recipients in much the same way as direct spending. For example, in order to boost demand for owner-occupied housing, the federal government provided tax credits of up to $8,000 to first-time homebuyers in 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a> </p>\n\n<p>Tax expenditures in the housing sector confer benefits to homeowners and renters, as well as the construction sector, developers, realtors and more. Subsidyscope illuminates the budgetary costs of these programs; however, any use of these data for policy evaluation must weigh those costs against the benefits they provide.  </p>\n\n\n<h4>The 13 Tax Subsidies for Housing </h4>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope identified 13 tax expenditures from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) tax expenditure budget that benefit the housing sector.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a>  (Treasury categorized 12 tax expenditures in the housing sector, and Subsidyscope added \u201cExclusion of interest on veterans housing bonds,\u201d based on its role in providing housing for veterans.) Subsidyscope further divided these tax subsidies into those that support homeownership and those that support rental housing. The five largest tax expenditures in the housing sector represent 91 percent ($168.7 billion) of all housing-related tax expenditures in fiscal year 2009. These five programs, all of which support homeownership, are described in more detail below. In addition, the largest tax expenditure for rental housing, \u201cException from passive loss rules for $25,000 of rental loss,\u201d is discussed below.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to keep in mind that when a subsidy boosts the demand for housing, home prices may rise, especially in areas where the housing supply responds slowly to changes in demand.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a> As a result, at least part of the tax benefit is capitalized into the price at the time the tax was enacted. Thus, the homeowner at the time of enactment was the primary beneficiary of the tax subsidy; to the extent that future homebuyers pay higher prices, the benefits they receive from the tax subsidy are offset by the higher price they pay for housing. Further, any reduction in the tax subsidy would potentially reduce current housing prices or cause them to grow more slowly over time depending on the specifics of the policy and how quickly it is phased in. </p>\n \n\n\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n<h5>Table 1: Housing Related Tax Expenditures for Individuals and Corporations, FY 2009</h5>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n\n<tr class=\"header-row\">\n  <td class=\"program full\">Tax Expenditure</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">FY 2009<br>($ millions)</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"program full\">Deductibility of mortgage interest on owner-occupied homes</td><td class=\"right\">$79,400</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program full\">Deductibility of State and local property tax on owner-occupied homes</td><td class=\"right\">$29,010</td></tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"program full\">Exclusion of net imputed rental income</td><td class=\"right\">$27,040</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program full\"><span>Capital</span> gains exclusion on home sales</td><td class=\"right\">$23,500</td></tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"program full\">Credit for homebuyer</td><td class=\"right\">$9,730</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program full\">Exception from passive loss rules for $25,000 of rental loss</td><td class=\"right\">$6,020</td></tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"program full\">Accelerated depreciation on rental housing (normal tax method)</td><td class=\"right\">$3,860</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program full\">Credit for low-income housing investments</td><td class=\"right\">$3,800</td></tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"program full\">Exclusion of interest on owner-occupied mortgage subsidy bonds</td><td class=\"right\">$960</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program full\">Exclusion of interest on rental housing bonds</td><td class=\"right\">$810</td></tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"program full\">Deferral of income from installment sales</td><td class=\"right\">$720</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program full\">Discharge of mortgage indebtedness</td><td class=\"right\">$360</td></tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"program full\">Exclusion of interest on veterans housing bonds<a href=\"#table1-footnote1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></td><td class=\"right\">$20</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd total\"><td class=\"program full\">Total</td><td class=\"right\">$185,230<a href=\"#table1-footnote2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of FY2009 data in <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/spec.pdf\">Analytical Perspectives</a>.

Homeowners may also deduct interest on the first $1.1 million in mortgage debt and home equity indebtedness for a second residence.<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a> </p>\n\n<p>From an economic perspective, a home produces a stream of benefits to its owner in the value of the implicit rental income (what a homeowner could earn if they rented the home to someone else; see more below on imputed rent). This income is not taxed for various reasons, one being the administrative difficulties that would be involved in trying to calculate such a tax. If the implicit rental income were taxed, a homeowner would deduct any expenses they incurred to earn that income, such as interest on a mortgage or taxes on the property, but then neither the MID nor the property tax deduction would constitute a subsidy.<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a> However, neither the interest on the mortgage nor the imputed rental income is taxed, therefore the MID constitutes a subsidy to homeowners.</p>\n\n<p>Given that homeownership is considered part of the American Dream, the MID garners great support and popularity across the country.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a> In fact, it has been said to rival Social Security as the \u201cthird rail\u201d of U.S. politics.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a> However, in recent years many have raised concerns over the effect of the deduction on the budget, and reform options have been discussed by the Congressional Budget Office,<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a> the Urban Institute<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a>  and the President\u2019s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a> A forthcoming report by The Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative and Subsidyscope will explore the implications of reform for households. </p>\n\n<h6>Deductibility of State and local property tax on owner-occupied homes: $29 billion</h6> \n\n<p>The second largest housing-related tax expenditure in fiscal year 2009 was the deduction for property taxes paid on owner-occupied residences, with an estimated revenue loss of $29 billion.<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a>  This provision allows certain homeowners who pay property taxes to state or local governments to claim an itemized deduction on their federal income taxes for those property taxes paid. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) notes that the rationale behind this deduction is that taxes paid to state or local governments reduce a taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay federal income tax, and therefore should be deducted before calculating the federal income tax owed.<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a></p>\n\n<p>CRS states that this provision subsidizes homeowners as well as state and local governments.<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a> Further, like the mortgage interest deduction and other tax expenditures targeted to homeowners, this tax subsidy reduces the cost of owning a home relative to renting.<a href=\"#footnote-16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a> </p>\n\n\n<h6>Exclusion of net imputed rental income: $27 billion</h6>\n\n<p>In addition to benefiting from the investment value of a home, the homeowner benefits financially from not having to pay rent (to themselves) because the home could have produced a stream of rental income if it were to be rented out. The value of this foregone rent is called \u2018imputed rental income.\u2019 A pure income tax would require a person to pay taxes on their imputed rental income (including any capital gains income) less the costs of owning and maintaining their home, such as mortgage interest and depreciation. There are various reasons why such income is not taxed in practice, including difficulties with implementation of such a tax. However, not taxing the net imputed rental income a person receives from living rent-free in their home is considered a tax expenditure by the Treasury.<a href=\"#footnote-17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a> </p>\n\n\n<h6>Capital gains exclusion on home sales: $23.5 billion</h6>\n\n<p>As previously noted, a pure income tax would apply to any capital gains that a homeowner earns on the home. However, a homeowner may exclude up to $250,000 ($500,000 for married taxpayers who filed jointly) of capital gains on the sale of a principal residence (no more than once every two years).<a href=\"#footnote-18\" class=\"footnote\">18</a> In fiscal year 2009, this exclusion represented an estimated $23.5 billion in lost tax revenue for the Treasury.<a href=\"#footnote-19\" class=\"footnote\">19</a> A \u2018capital gain\u2019 on a residence is the profit made on a house, or the increase in value from the time that a home was purchased to the time it was sold, less the value of improvements.</p>\n\n<p>CRS notes that this exclusion \u201cgives homeownership a competitive advantage over other types of investments, since the capital gains from investments in other assets are generally taxed when the assets are sold.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a> Combined with the other tax preferences for housing listed here, this makes homeownership a particularly attractive investment. </p>\n\n<h6>Credit for homebuyers: $10 billion</h6>\n\n<p>The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established a tax credit for first-time homebuyers worth up to $7,500.<a href=\"#footnote-21\" class=\"footnote\">21</a> The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded the first-time homebuyer credit by increasing the credit amount to $8,000 for purchases made before December 1, 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-22\" class=\"footnote\">22</a> The Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009 extended the purchase deadline to May 1, 2010 (with a closing deadline of July 1, 2010),<a href=\"#footnote-23\" class=\"footnote\">23</a> and legislation enacted in July 2010 extended the closing deadline for the purchase of a first home to September 30, 2010.<a href=\"#footnote-24\" class=\"footnote\">24</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Exception from passive loss rules for $25,000 of rental loss: $6 billion</h6>\n\n<p>The largest tax expenditure for rental housing is the exception from passive loss rules for rental loss. \u2018Passive activities\u2019 are \u201cthose in which the taxpayer does not materially participate . . .   [T]here are numerous additional considerations brought to bear on the determination of which activities are passive for a given taxpayer.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-25\" class=\"footnote\">25</a> Under the Internal Revenue Code, losses that result from passive activities are generally not allowed to be deducted from taxable income unless that income is also passive.<a href=\"#footnote-26\" class=\"footnote\">26</a> However, exceptions apply in certain cases, such as for rental losses. Although investments in rental properties are considered passive activities, the owner of such a property may deduct up to $25,000 of loss from non-passive taxable income as long as the taxpayer actively participates in the property and meets the income requirements of less than $100,000 a year.<a href=\"#footnote-27\" class=\"footnote\">27</a> </p>\n\n<h4>Homeownership Receives 92 Percent of Housing Tax Subsidies</h4>\n\n<p>The list of housing tax subsidies can be categorized to compare those that benefit homeownership and those that benefit rental housing. The chart below illustrates that nearly all (92 percent or $171 billion) of federal income tax subsidies for housing benefit homeownership. In addition, all four tax expenditures in the rental category go to the owners of rental property, but the assumption is that some of the tax benefits are passed on to renters. Tax subsidies to rental property owners benefit renters to the extent that the owners voluntarily, or as a condition of the subsidy, are compelled to lower rents or increase the stock of rental properties available.<a href=\"#footnote-28\" class=\"footnote\">28</a> </p>\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n\n\n<h5>Table 2: Housing Tax Expenditures that Support Homeownership and Rental Activity, FY 2009</h5>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n\n<tr class=\"header-row\">\n  <td class=\"program full\">Tax Expenditure</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">FY 2009<br>($ millions)</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"odd total\"><td class=\"program\" style=\"padding-left:10px;\" >Supports Homeownership Activity</td><td></td></tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Deductibility of mortgage interest on owner-occupied homes</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$79,400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Deductibility of State and local property tax on owner-occupied homes</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$29,010</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr class=\"even\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Exclusion of net imputed rental income</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$27,040</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Capital gains exclusion on home sales</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$23,500</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr class=\"even\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Credit for homebuyer</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$9,730</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Exclusion of interest on owner-occupied mortgage subsidy bonds</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$960</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Deferral of income from installment sales<a href=\"#table2-footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a> </td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$720</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Discharge of mortgage indebtedness</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$360</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Veterans Housing Bonds</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$20</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"odd total\"><td class=\"program full\">Total</td><td class=\"right\">$170,740</td></tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even total\"><td class=\"program\" style=\"padding-left:10px;\" >Supports Rental Activity</td><td></td></tr>\n\n\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Exception from passive loss rules for $25,000 of rental loss</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$6,020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Accelerated depreciation on rental housing (normal tax method)</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$3,860</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Credit for low-income housing investments</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$3,800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n        <td class=\"program full\">Exclusion of interest on rental housing bonds</td>\n        <td class=\"right\">$810</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"odd total\"><td class=\"program full\">Total</td><td class=\"right\">$14,490</td></tr>\n\n<tr class=\"even total\"><td style=\"padding-left:10px;\" class=\"program\">Grand Total</td><td class=\"right\">$185,230<a href=\"#table2-footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a> </td></tr>\n\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of FY2009 data in <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/spec.pdf\">Analytical Perspectives</a>.

This funding, administered by four agencies across more than 60 active programs, accounted for over 8 percent of all government grants made that year ($716.8 billion). Also during fiscal year 2009, housing-related contracts totaled $1.5 billion, less than one percent of all government contracts ($523.8 billion). Of the $1.5 billion in housing contracts, $0.3 billion, or 20 percent, were not competed.<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a>  While not all contracts contain a subsidy, non-competed contracts are more likely to contain a subsidy than competed contracts. </p>\n\n<p>It is important to note the distinction between <em>spending</em> on grants and contracts, and the <em>subsidies</em> conveyed through that spending. Not all of the money obligated to a grant or contract ends up subsidizing the housing sector; for example, some grant funds are devoted to administering the grants or other activities that do not affect housing availability or prices. Unfortunately, little data are available that would help estimate the subsidy portion of spending on housing-related grants and contracts. In the absence of this information, Subsidyscope reports the total amount spent on grants and contracts that are most likely to contain a subsidy. As stated above, not all the spending in these programs would properly be counted as a subsidy; thus, the spending estimates presented here constitute the upper bound of government subsidies in this sector.</p>\n\n<p>The direct expenditure totals presented on this Web page are compiled using government data from USASpending.gov and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. This federal data can sometimes be of <a href=\"/data-quality/\">poor quality</a>, particularly in the form of potential errors or omissions made by the reporting agencies. Users of this data should be aware that it is often updated over time. Subsidyscope reports the data as it appears at the time of our analysis (denoted by the time stamp at the bottom of each Web page).</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"charts floatr\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\n<h5>Figure 1: Expenditures on Grant Programs <br>in the Housing Sector, FY2000-2009 ($ billions)</h5>\n<img src=\"/media/images/charts/housing/housing_direct_expenditures_billions.png\"><br>\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of data from USAspending.gov. Estimates are in nominal dollars and reflect the data as they appear in USAspending.gov at the time of this analysis.<br/><br/>\nNote: Data presented are obligations to programs that Subsidyscope deem likely to contain a subsidy. All grant programs in Subsidyscope's definition of the housing sector are included, with the exception of the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program which is not reported in USASpending.gov. Changes in government reporting methods during fiscal year 2007 make the estimates for that year highly unreliable. Further, Subsidyscope believes that some of the variation in obligation amounts prior to 2006 is due to incomplete reporting of Section 8 funding.  It is not clear whether these omissions are due to reporting errors, or to changes in the way the Section 8 program was operated and funded over that period.

As shown in Figure 1, these programs distributed $59.1 billion in housing-related spending in fiscal year 2009&mdash;a 54 percent increase over the $38.4 billion reported in fiscal year 2008. Much of this increase is attributable to stimulus funding and to a boost in obligations to the Community Development <span>Block</span> Grants program.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a> Unfortunately, as noted above, estimates of the actual subsidy provided by these programs are often not calculated or made available. These spending estimates constitute an upper bound of the actual subsidy conveyed to the housing sector.</p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of housing grant funds are administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Justice and the Interior, among others, also operate housing-related programs (though not all were active in fiscal year 2009).<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a> While the federal government funded 66 active housing programs in fiscal year 2009, much of the direct spending took place in a handful of large programs (described below). Most housing grant programs are relatively small, with nearly 40 programs in fiscal year 2009 reporting obligations of less than $50 million and several reporting no obligations at all (see Table 1 at the bottom of the page). </p>\n\n<p>In many cases, these funds are first granted to state or local governments, which then administer the funds to the ultimate beneficiaries. In particular, HUD operates several large block grant programs that provide grants to state or local governments for a variety of housing-related activities, often through predetermined formulas that allocate the funds based on factors such as population or need.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a> For example, in fiscal year 2009, the Home Investment Partnership (HOME) Program distributed more than $1.8 billion to states, cities and counties that, in turn, distributed the funds locally to improve the supply of affordable housing.<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a> \n\n  \n<p>Unlike other types of government spending which focus on homeownership, such as tax deductions and government-backed mortgage guarantees, the majority of grant programs target rental housing. In fact, 73 percent of all grant spending is targeted solely at helping renters, with the remaining 27 percent helping a mix of both renters and homeowners.  The five largest housing grant programs are described in more detail below, and the full list of programs is available in Table 1 at the bottom of the page. For additional information on grants to the housing sector, visit Subsidyscope\u2019s <a href=\"/housing/direct-expenditures/search/\">searchable database</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Although not reported by USAspending.gov (and thus not in Subsidyscope's grant database or grant totals), the government enacted multiple foreclosure prevention programs in response to the housing and financial crisis. For example, the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) was created in 2009 with the goal of lowering monthly mortgage payments for struggling homeowners.<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a> HAMP and several other assistance programs were funded in part through $50 billion in allocations from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (commonly known as TARP), though only about $710 million had been disbursed through the end of fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a> HAMP has funded permanent modifications for an estimated 500,000 homeowners as of October 2009.   Other foreclosure prevention programs, such as HOPE for Homeowners, are discussed on Subsidyscope's <a href=\"/housing/risk-transfers/\">risk transfers page</a>.</p>\n \n<h4>The Five Most Costly Housing Grant Programs (FY2009)</h4>\n\n<h6>Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers: $16.3 billion</h6>\n\n<p>The Section 8 Voucher program is the largest housing-related grant program, receiving $16.3 billion in funding in fiscal year 2009&mdash;nearly 28 percent of all housing grants. These resources are distributed to local public housing authorities (PHAs), who, in turn, provide payment vouchers to landlords on behalf of low-income renters. The voucher recipient pays 30 percent of their income directly to a landlord, and the PHA pays the difference between this and the fair market rent of the area.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a> Once a household is assigned a voucher, it is generally \u2018portable,\u2019 meaning that the household can apply it to any eligible unit in any area of the U.S. where a voucher program exists.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a> In 2009, the Section 8 Voucher program provided an estimated 2 million vouchers to households earning below 80 percent of the area median income.<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a></p>\n\n   \n<h6>Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Program: $8.8 billion</h6>\n\n<p>Unlike the Section 8 Voucher program (which ties rental assistance to a household), the Section 8 HAP Program ties rental assistance to a unit of housing via a contract with HUD.<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a> In fiscal year 2009, this program made $8.8 billion in rental assistance payments to existing owners of project-based Section 8 housing on behalf of eligible families.<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a> This estimate includes $2.0 billion in funding from the 2008 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a> Though no new Section 8 HAP contracts have been signed since the 1980s, existing contracts with housing projects continue to provide assistance for at least 1.3 million units of affordable housing.<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a></p>\n\n\n<h6>Community Development <span>Block</span> Grants/Entitlement Grants (CDBG): $7.4 billion</h6>\n\n<p>In fiscal year 2009, nearly $7.4 billion were distributed through CDBG Entitlement Grants (including $667 million provided through ARRA).<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a> The CDBG program, which aims to improve both housing and economic opportunities for low-income households, consists of several distinct programs, of which Entitlement Grants is only one (see Box 1 for additional information on CDBG programs).<a href=\"#footnote-16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a> The CDBG Entitlement Grants program is administered primarily to urban areas through a statutory formula.<a href=\"#footnote-17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a> In fiscal year 2008 (the latest year for which this data is available), approximately 30 percent of the funds supported activities directly related to housing, and another 24 percent supported public improvements such as new or refurbished fire stations, streets and sidewalks.<a href=\"#footnote-18\" class=\"footnote\">18</a> The remainder was spent on other public services like financial counseling or economic development.<a href=\"#footnote-19\" class=\"footnote\">19</a></p>\n\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; padding: 0 25px 0 25px;\">\n\n<h4>Box 1: Housing and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG)</h4>\n\n<p>Some government programs combine housing-specific activities with community development or even broader goals, such as energy conservation. The line between what is and is not a housing-related grant program is not always clear, especially in these broadly-defined programs. Subsidyscope has identified housing-related programs to the best of its ability given these circumstances, erring on the side of being inclusive.</p>\n\n<p>Programs could be in the housing sector for two reasons: they affect housing directly by explicitly creating or preserving housing, and indirectly by creating conditions which materially affect the housing market. Thus, programs that appear primarily related to community development (rather than targeted specifically at housing) may be included in the housing sector.</p>\n  \n<p>CDBG is a broad HUD-administered program that provides resources to address a range of community development needs. These needs are addressed through a variety of programs, such as \u201cEntitlement Grants\u201d or \u201cState Programs and Non-Entitlement Grants,\u201d all under the CDBG umbrella. Across all these programs, more than 25 percent of funding, on average, goes to <a href=\"http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/communitydevelopment/budget/disbursementreports/profiles/National_Expenditure_FY09.xls\">housing-specific activities</a>. Thus, most CDBG-related programs were considered a part of the housing sector. </p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n \n<h6>Public and Indian Housing: $4.4 billion</h6>\n\n<p>HUD provided $4.4 billion in operating assistance to PHAs in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a> Through more than 3,100 PHAs, these funds provided roughly 1.2 million units of publicly-owned housing to families generally earning below 80 percent of the area median income.<a href=\"#footnote-21\" class=\"footnote\">21</a>  Similar to Section 8, these families pay 30 percent of their income towards rent with the balance paid by grant funds.<a href=\"#footnote-22\" class=\"footnote\">22</a></p>\n\n<h6>Public Housing Capital Fund: $5.3 billion</h6>\n\n<p>In addition to the operating funds mentioned above, PHAs also received $5.3 billion through HUD\u2019s Public Housing Capital Fund to support capital improvements to public housing in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-23\" class=\"footnote\">23</a> This estimate includes funding from ARRA which, at $3.0 billion, comprised more than half of the funding for that program in 2009.

Estimates are in nominal dollars and reflect the data as they appear in USAspending.gov at the time of this analysis.<br/><br/>\nNote: Subsidyscope believes that government spending on non-competed contracts is actually more consistent during this time period than the figure represents, and that the dips reflect poor data resulting from reporting variation, rather than actual decreases in housing-related contracts. See the text below for additional information.\n</cite>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4>Spending on Non-competed Contracts: About $280 Million in FY2009</h4>\n\n<p>In addition to awarding grants, the government directly contracts with organizations to provide housing-related goods and services, such as the management or sale of HUD-owned homes and apartment buildings, property appraisal, or program evaluation.<a href=\"#footnote-25\" class=\"footnote\">25</a>   In fiscal year 2009, the federal government executed non-competed contracts totaling nearly $280 million in the housing-sector. \n</p>\n\n<p>As noted above, Subsidyscope presents spending on programs deemed likely to contain a subsidy, rather than the subsidy amount itself.  Under a contract, a subsidy occurs when the government pays more than fair market value for a good or service. In many cases it is difficult to determine when a subsidy is included, as the fair market value may be a matter of opinion. Therefore, Subsidyscope does not attempt to determine which specific contracts include a subsidy or measure the amount of the subsidy. We do presume, however, that competed contracts&mdash;contracts that are subject to an open bidding process&mdash;are generally less likely to have a subsidy component, even though the bidding process may include certain preferences. </p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope's focus on non-competed contracts reflects the fact that the federal government generally prefers agencies to compete contracts because competition is expected to result in lower costs and/or better quality goods and services. In contrast, non-competed contracts are generally assumed to be more likely to cost the government higher than the fair market value.<a href=\"#footnote-26\" class=\"footnote\">26</a> </p>\n\n<p>In fiscal year 2009, some of the largest of these contracts relate to Management and Marketing (M&M) services. When an FHA-insured loan goes into default, HUD relies on local M&M contractors to manage and market the sale of the property.<a href=\"#footnote-27\" class=\"footnote\">27</a> Other contracts are directed toward the maintenance or construction of military housing; these military contracts are among the few related to new construction.<a href=\"#footnote-28\" class=\"footnote\">28</a> </p>\n\n<p>The total amount of contracts reported is likely to underestimate the government\u2019s role in construction and other activities in the housing sector. As is apparent in the Grants section above, HUD and other agencies provide funds to nonprofits, states, or other entities, who in turn may contract or subcontract with other entities to construct or renovate housing.<a href=\"#footnote-29\" class=\"footnote\">29</a> These contracts and subcontracts are not reflected in the estimates presented here.</p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope has previously determined that there can be problems with the quality of the contracts data that are reported by agencies to USAspending.gov. In order to sort government contracts by economic sector, Subsidyscope uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes to match contracts to the appropriate economic sector, or Product Service Codes if NAICS codes are not available. (See Section C of Subsidyscope's <a href=\"/methodology/\">methodology</a> for more on how contracts are organized by sector.) </p>\n\n<p>Specifically, for the data presented in Figure 2 above, Subsidyscope found that there is significant variation in agencies' use of NAICS codes when reporting contracts to USAspending.gov over the ten-year period from fiscal year 2000 to 2010. This inconsistent application of NAICS codes as well as other reporting variations are likely responsible for the large drop in the reported number of non-competed contracts in the housing sector from fiscal year 2000 to 2001 and the spike in contracts in fiscal year 2005. Subsidyscope believes that levels of contracting were actually more consistent during this time period than Figure 2 represents. </p>\n\n<p>To access Subsidyscope's search interfaces for direct expenditures data from the federal government\u2019s USAspending.gov web site, click <a href=\"/housing/direct-expenditures/search/\">here</a> for grants and <a href=\"/housing/contracts/search/\">here</a> for non-competed contracts.

Through loans, loan guarantees, and other risk transfers, the federal government assumes risks on behalf of taxpayers that would otherwise be borne by individuals, businesses or other investors. These efforts can improve the ability of homebuyers and developers to obtain financing to purchase, construct or renovate homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through such risk transfers, the government has made a large financial commitment to housing.  In 2009 (all years are fiscal years unless otherwise stated), more than $4 billion was directly loaned to individuals or companies for the purpose of financing homes (see Table 1 below). Also in 2009, federal agencies issued guarantees totaling $688 billion on loans for housing-related activities (see Table 2 below); this includes guarantees of securities backed by mortgages already carrying a federal guarantee. The ultimate subsidy cost of these loan and guarantee commitments is uncertain, as most are projected to be repaid by the borrowers and some federal sources project they may result in a profit to the government.<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a> In addition, these estimates do not take into account administrative costs or market risk and are likely underestimates (see Box 1 below for more information).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the government provided a net $93 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in fiscal year 2009 by purchasing preferred stock from these two housing-related government sponsored enterprises (GSEs).<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a>  On a fair value basis, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated the subsidy cost of taking on their liabilities to be $291 billion through 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a> Federal agencies also purchased more than a trillion dollars of mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs, among other activities related to the government response to the financial crisis.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a> It is difficult to analyze the extent to which some of these actions contain subsidies specific to the housing sector. Subsidyscope presents these activities in order to illustrate the government's role in this sector; these estimates should be used with caution as it may take several years to determine how much subsidy they will ultimately convey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subsidy costs of housing loans and guarantee programs are uncertain and likely underestimates, and costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac vary widely. Therefore, Subsidyscope does not add them to grants and tax expenditures.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; padding: 0 25px 0 25px;\">\r\n\r\n<h4>Box 1: Estimating the Costs of Loans and Loan Guarantees</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the amount of loan and guarantee commitments illustrates the breadth of the government's role in the housing sector, it does not measure the subsidy costs that will ultimately be incurred. The government does estimate the subsidy conveyed through such credit programs as the net cost to the government of a loan or loan guarantee, calculated by summing all the expected future cash flows to and from the government; this is the cost the government is required to present under the 1990 Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA).<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a> However, many argue that there is also an implicit subsidy&mdash;not measured by the government under FCRA&mdash;that results from excluding the costs of program administration and market risk (which arises from volatility in the economy).<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a> This implicit subsidy is generally the difference between the terms the recipient would get in a competitive market and those offered by the government.Thus Subsidyscope does not present an aggregate total for the subsidy provided. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Tables 1 and 2 below, Subsidyscope provides information about housing-related loan and loan guarantee programs. As is evident in the tables, the government usually reports a \u201csubsidy rate\u201d for these programs, as required by FCRA. This rate represents the projected net cost (in current dollars) to the government divided by the total exposure of the program.<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a> A positive subsidy rate indicates there is a net cost to the government, and that a subsidy is being provided to the borrower. A negative subsidy rate by contrast means that the government predicts it will receive more money than it pays out in a particular program. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If these government-estimated subsidy rates are applied to the total volume of loans and guarantees in the housing sector, the direct loans ($4 billion) would be projected to cost under $0.3 billion, and the loan guarantees ($688 billion) would be projected to generate over $1 billion in earnings for the government.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a>  As noted above, these rates do not include administrative costs or market risks, and thus likely underestimate the subsidy. For example, CBO reported that if these costs were factored into the government's FY2007 calculations of the Federal Housing Administration's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Program, the program would cost money rather than make money for the government.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a> For more information about subsidy estimates, please visit Subsidyscope\u2019s general discussion of <a href=\"/loans/\">risk transfers</a>.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data in Tables 1 and 2 are derived primarily from the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/cr_supp.pdf\">Federal Credit Supplement</a> (FCS) section of the President's Budget. While they are the best federal data available for specific programs, these estimates should be used with caution.<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a> In particular, users of these data should be aware that the FCS omits some program activity. Further, while other budget documents provide estimates of actual budgets and, in some cases, subsidy amounts, they do not provide the program-level detail available in the FCS.<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a> The loan and loan guarantee programs presented in Tables 1 and 2 are discussed further in the following sections.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Direct Loan Programs: Small Portion of Risk Transfers</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, the federal government obligated $4 billion in direct loans for housing, a 90 percent increase over the $2.2 billion obligated in 2008.<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a> Many of these commitments will be repaid by the borrowers; FCRA-required government-estimated subsidy rates indicate that these direct loans would cost under $0.3 billion, though this may be an underestimate (see Box 1 above). (These estimates exclude the \u201cGSE MBS Purchases\u201d program, which was listed in the 2009 FCS as a direct loan program. Subsidyscope discusses this housing-related program in the sections below.) These loans were distributed by three federal agencies through 15 programs. Although specific terms may differ from program to program, they generally enable lower income borrowers to finance the purchase or construction of homes at low interest rates or other favorable loan terms.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly 70 percent ($2.9 billion) of the 2009 loan obligations was distributed through the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Housing Service (RHS). Initially targeted to farmers,<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a> the primary goal of RHS is to provide loans, grants and other financing for housing in rural areas.<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a> In 2009, RHS pursued these goals through 11 credit programs. The largest of these, known as the Section 502 Single-Family Housing program, provided $2.6 billion in direct loans in 2009&mdash;more than double the amount loaned in 2008.  These below-market-interest-rate loans are available to low-income borrowers for the purposes of buying or repairing homes in rural areas.<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other direct loan programs in 2009 were administered through the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  These programs generally work to improve the housing choices available to active service members or veterans. For example, the Family Housing Improvement Fund aims to enhance the quality of military housing by making direct loans to developers for construction of on- or off-base housing.<a href=\"#footnote-16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a>  The largest defense housing program in 2009, the VA-administered Vendee Loans program, finances loans on foreclosed properties acquired by the VA through its other housing assistance programs.<a href=\"#footnote-17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a>  In 2009, this program obligated nearly $1 billion in direct loans, more than three times the amount obligated in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\r\n<h5>Table 1: Direct Loans in the Housing Sector (excluding Treasury purchases of GSE MBS), Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009</h5>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"header-row\">\r\n  <td style=\"text-align:left;\">Program</td>\r\n  <td  style=\"text-align: left;\">Agency</td>\r\n  <td style=\"text-align: right;\">2008 Subsidy<br/>Rate %</td>\r\n  <td style=\"text-align: right;\">2008 Obligations<br/>\r\n($ millions)</td>\r\n  <td style=\"text-align: right;\">2009 Subsidy<br/>Rate %</td>\r\n  <td style=\"text-align: right;\">2009 Obligations<br/>\r\n($ millions)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program\">Single-Family Housing Credit Sales</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">USDA -

The majority of this increase occurred in two programs: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Program operated by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and Guarantees of Mortgage-backed Securities made through the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FHA, an arm of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), administered nearly two dozen loan guarantee programs in 2009. Though each program is distinct, they share the primary function of insuring mortgages made by private lenders.<a href=\"#footnote-19\" class=\"footnote\">19</a>  By guaranteeing mortgages against default, FHA programs (like other loan guarantee programs) allow lenders to make riskier loans than they otherwise would. This, in turn, enables higher risk borrowers with fewer resources or limited credit history to obtain financing for housing.<a href=\"#footnote-20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FHA programs issued a total of $321 billion of loan guarantees in 2009. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Program is the largest, committing $285 billion in loan guarantees&mdash;nearly four times more than committed in 2008 (see Table 2 below). To qualify for this single-family mortgage insurance, a borrower must be purchasing a home with fewer than four housing units, within loan limits set by Congress.<a href=\"#footnote-21\" class=\"footnote\">21</a> The borrower must also have a down payment of at least 3.5 percent and meet minimum credit requirements.<a href=\"#footnote-22\" class=\"footnote\">22</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the years preceding the 2008 financial crisis, the demand for this type of insurance was steadily dropping&mdash;FHA\u2019s market share of home purchase mortgages declined from 16 percent in 1995 to 3 percent in 2005 and 2006.<a href=\"#footnote-23\" class=\"footnote\">23</a> Generally lower interest rates, the increasing availability of alternative mortgage products and rising home prices led homebuyers and lenders to other types of financing.  In the wake of the financial crisis, tightened credit limited the availability of these alternatives, and FHA has again become a popular option for borrowers.<a href=\"#footnote-24\" class=\"footnote\">24</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ginnie Mae has experienced similar growth in recent years&mdash;it has nearly quadrupled its volume of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) guarantees, from $77 billion in 2008 to $300 billion in 2009 (see Table 2 below). Ginnie Mae, a government-owned corporation within HUD, guarantees the MBS created from qualifying FHA, VA, and RHS loans.<a href=\"#footnote-25\" class=\"footnote\">25</a> As the volume of loans guaranteed by these agencies has increased, so has the supply of Ginnie Mae guarantees. Moreover, Ginnie Mae MBS guarantees provide retail lenders with ready access to secondary financing markets, as both the securities themselves and the mortgages comprising them are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government.<a href=\"#footnote-26\" class=\"footnote\">26</a> This ability to easily package and sell government-guaranteed loans as mortgage-backed securities further enhances the popularity of programs like the FHA.<a href=\"#footnote-27\" class=\"footnote\">27</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upheavals in the mortgage market starting in 2007 greatly increased losses on outstanding federal loan guarantees.<a href=\"#footnote-28\" class=\"footnote\">28</a> For example, in 2009, FHA\u2019s losses in its Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund reduced its reserve balance with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) below the two percent minimum that it is statutorily mandated to maintain.<a href=\"#footnote-29\" class=\"footnote\">29</a> The MMI Fund comprised 89 percent of FHA\u2019s total insurance-in-force in 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-30\" class=\"footnote\">30</a> Though the amount of outstanding loan guarantees issued by the Fund increased 54 percent between 2008 and 2009 (from $448 billion to $691 billion), the estimated future costs of those loan guarantees grew by 65 percent (from $17 billion to $28 billion).<a href=\"#footnote-31\" class=\"footnote\">31</a> The reserve ratio of this Fund is not projected to exceed two percent again until 2013.<a href=\"#footnote-32\" class=\"footnote\">32</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like FHA, many participants in the mortgage market have incurred significant risk and costs associated with mortgage defaults in recent years.<a href=\"#footnote-33\" class=\"footnote\">33</a> In a 2008 report entitled <em>Defaulting on the Dream</em>, the Pew Center on the States noted that as of December 2007, 1.6 million loans were in foreclosure or 90 days past due&mdash;a 55 percent increase from a year earlier.<a href=\"#footnote-34\" class=\"footnote\">34</a> The government has initiated several programs broadly intended to help homeowners keep their homes through loan modifications that, for example, reduce the interest rates or the principals on mortgages.<a href=\"#footnote-35\" class=\"footnote\">35</a> Counseling and other loss mitigation programs are discussed further below. </p>\r\n \r\n\r\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\r\n\r\n<h5>Table 2: Loan Guarantees in the Housing Sector, Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009</h5>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"header-row\">\r\n  <td style=\"text-align:left;\">Program</td>\r\n  <td style=\"text-align: left;\">Agency</td>\r\n  <td style=\"text-align: right;\">2008 Subsidy<br/>Rate %</td>\r\n  <td style=\"text-align: right;\">2008 Commitments<br/>\r\n($ millions)</td>\r\n  <td style=\"text-align: right;\">2009 Subsidy<br/>Rate %</td>\r\n  <td style=\"text-align: right;\">2009 Commitments<br/>\r\n($ millions)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"program\">Guaranteed 502 Single Family Housing, Purchase</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">USDA -

The Federal Home Loan Banks System (FHLB) borrows money which it subsequently lends to banks and other institutions that issue mortgage loans.<a href=\"#footnote-39\" class=\"footnote\">39</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The missions of all three GSEs include the promotion of affordable housing in addition to their housing finance and liquidity goals.<a href=\"#footnote-40\" class=\"footnote\">40</a> The Congressional Research Service (CRS) notes that \u201cthese institutions are widely credited with lowering the cost of home mortgages.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-41\" class=\"footnote\">41</a> They are also among the largest financial institutions in the U.S.<a href=\"#footnote-42\" class=\"footnote\">42</a>  According to the Office of Management and Budget, \u201ctogether these three GSEs currently are involved, in one form or another, with more than one half of the $11 trillion residential mortgages outstanding in the U.S. today [2010], not including indirect investments through advances of the FHLBs.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-43\" class=\"footnote\">43</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though privately owned, they receive the benefit of many privileges through their status as GSEs, some of which may result in subsidies to the housing sector.<a href=\"#footnote-44\" class=\"footnote\">44</a> According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the federal charters of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u201chave allowed the two entities to borrow at interest rates lower than those paid by comparable finance companies\u2026. The lower borrowing costs enjoyed by the two entities flowed to participants in the housing market in the form of lower mortgage rates and to the entities\u2019 stockholders in the form of higher profits.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-45\" class=\"footnote\">45</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial crisis proved to be catastrophic to the GSEs, particularly Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Both were taken into government conservatorship under authority granted in the 2008 Housing Economic and Recovery Act (discussed further in the following section).<a href=\"#footnote-46\" class=\"footnote\">46</a> The cost of Fannie and Freddie became more apparent when the government seized the companies in 2008 and put them in conservatorship.  This and other federal actions intended to stabilize U.S. mortgage and financial markets are discussed further below. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Housing Fallout Leads to Government Bailout</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The high level of government support for housing rose as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. As the prices of homes declined in 2007, Congress and the Federal Reserve began to adopt a series of policies designed to minimize the resulting losses to homebuyers, banks and the financial system as a whole.<a href=\"#footnote-47\" class=\"footnote\">47</a>  Below, Subsidyscope describes several of the actions related to risk transfers that were undertaken in the wake of the crisis.  For a more exhaustive look at these actions, please see HUD\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.huduser.org/Publications/PDF/Foreclosure_09.pdf\">Report to Congress on the Root Causes of the Foreclosure Crisis</a>.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2008, Congress enacted the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA).<a href=\"#footnote-48\" class=\"footnote\">48</a>  This Act, as noted by CRS, \u201cis likely to affect most owner-occupied housing in the United States through a variety of channels.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-49\" class=\"footnote\">49</a>  In response to the eroding financial conditions of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their roles in maintaining a functioning mortgage market, HERA reorganized and strengthened the regulation of the GSEs.<a href=\"#footnote-50\" class=\"footnote\">50</a>  HERA also authorized the Treasury to provide assistance to the GSEs and other financial institutions in order to stabilize financial and credit markets, as well as the overall economy.<a href=\"#footnote-51\" class=\"footnote\">51</a>  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under this authority, Treasury began to lend directly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through purchases of senior preferred stock. These investments, for which Treasury receives dividend payments, were intended to ensure that each GSE maintained a positive net worth.<a href=\"#footnote-52\" class=\"footnote\">52</a>  The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), a regulatory agency created by HERA to oversee the GSEs, reported that the GSEs received a net $93 billion in fiscal year 2009, (for a net total of $135 billion through June 2010).<a href=\"#footnote-53\" class=\"footnote\">53</a>  The net cumulative investment in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is projected by the FHFA to grow by an additional $6 to $124 billion through 2013.<a href=\"#footnote-54\" class=\"footnote\">54</a>  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other government agencies have also estimated the costs on the liabilities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Like FHFA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reports the preferred stock purchase agreements made by Treasury; OMB counts this cash flow as an outlay to a non-governmental entity.<a href=\"#footnote-55\" class=\"footnote\">55</a>  In contrast, CBO treats Fannie and Freddie as governmental entities.<a href=\"#footnote-56\" class=\"footnote\">56</a> <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12032/12-23-FannieFreddie.pdf\">CBO estimated</a> that on a fair value basis the liabilities of these two GSEs cost the government $291 billion in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-57\" class=\"footnote\">57</a> For more information, see Box 2. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury also began making purchases of MBS issued by the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.<a href=\"#footnote-58\" class=\"footnote\">58</a> The FHFA reported that these purchases totaled $189 billion during fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-59\" class=\"footnote\">59</a> In addition, Treasury also established a short-term line of credit under the Act, which neither enterprise had used by the time its authority expired in December 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-60\" class=\"footnote\">60</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBO notes that the aid given to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship enabled them to continue operating when private financial institutions were struggling. In 2009, the two GSEs financed about 75 percent of new mortgages originated in that year. If loans insured by agencies like the FHA also are included, the CBO reports that \"more than 90 percent of new mortgages made in 2009 carried a federal guarantee.\"<a href=\"#footnote-61\" class=\"footnote\">61</a>  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the Treasury's activities, the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase up to $1.25 trillion of MBS guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.<a href=\"#footnote-62\" class=\"footnote\">62</a> The purchase program also extended to the FHLB.<a href=\"#footnote-63\" class=\"footnote\">63</a> The Federal Reserve noted that \u201cthe goal of the program was to provide support to mortgage and housing markets and to foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-64\" class=\"footnote\">64</a> As of October 2010, the Federal Reserve had purchased all but $2.9 billion of the amount to which it committed.<a href=\"#footnote-65\" class=\"footnote\">65</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analyzing actions such as those taken by the Federal Reserve in response to the financial crisis presents challenges: many of them were intended to stabilize not only the housing market, but the economy as a whole. This makes it difficult to analyze the extent to which some actions contain subsidies specific to the housing sector. Subsidyscope presents these activities in order to illustrate the government's role in this sector; these estimates should be used with caution as it may take several years to determine how much subsidy they will ultimately convey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the government worked to stabilize the mortgage credit markets, it also created programs to help prevent individual homeowners from defaulting.  For instance, the HOPE for Homeowners program, listed as a loan guarantee program in Table 2 above, authorizes the FHA to guarantee up to $300 billion in loans intended to replace mortgages with interest rates too high for the borrowers to service.<a href=\"#footnote-66\" class=\"footnote\">66</a> Although the program initially struggled to attract participants (CRS reports that it closed only 50 new mortgages in its first 9 months),<a href=\"#footnote-67\" class=\"footnote\">67</a> the program has since been modified and it guaranteed $900 million in mortgages in 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-68\" class=\"footnote\">68</a> A report from HUD and the Treasury on a selection of other foreclosure programs estimated that they began 3.5 million modification arrangements between April 2009 and August 2010.<a href=\"#footnote-69\" class=\"footnote\">69</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the risk transfers described above, HERA enacted many other provisions intended to support housing-related activities, some of which are described elsewhere on Subsidyscope\u2019s web site. For example, the Act established a tax credit for first-time homebuyers originally worth up to $7,500, described in more detail on Subsidyscope\u2019s <a href=\"/housing/tax-expenditures/\">tax subsidy page</a>.<a href=\"#footnote-70\" class=\"footnote\">70</a> The Neighborhood Stabilization Program provides funding to state and local governments for the redevelopment of foreclosed or abandoned homes.<a href=\"#footnote-71\" class=\"footnote\">71</a> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; padding: 0 25px 0 25px;\">\r\n\r\n<h4>Box 2: Public or Private? Calculating the Costs of Conservatorship</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are alternate methods for quantifying the cost of the government\u2019s conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie. The way in which one calculates the impact of these two entities on the federal budget depends on whether one assumes they are governmental entities.  CBO treats Fannie and Freddie as governmental entities for budgeting purposes, and thus considers their operational costs as subsidy costs to the federal government.<a href=\"#footnote-72\" class=\"footnote\">72</a> <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12032/12-23-FannieFreddie.pdf\">CBO estimated</a> (and <a href=\"/bailout/treasury/fannie-freddie/\">Subsidyscope itself reported</a>) that on a fair value basis, the operations of Fannie and Freddie cost the government $291 billion in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-73\" class=\"footnote\">73</a> This estimate included expected losses from transactions made before conservatorship, as well as losses on new commitments made in 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-74\" class=\"footnote\">74</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) treats Fannie and Freddie as nongovernmental entities for budgeting purposes.<a href=\"#footnote-75\" class=\"footnote\">75</a>  As such, it considers the preferred stock cash infusions into Fannie and Freddie (rather than their operational costs) as outlays&mdash;an estimated $95.6 billion in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-76\" class=\"footnote\">76</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBO notes that \u201cone can think of the infusion estimates as capturing only the expected cash shortfalls between the entities\u2019 fees and losses. The subsidy estimates, in comparison, incorporate both the expected cash shortfalls and the risk premium that a private investor would demand for bearing the risk that those shortfalls could be much larger than expected.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-77\" class=\"footnote\">77</a>  Thus, CBO treats all of Fannie and Freddie's liabilities, as well as their potential costs and risks, as government liabilities. OMB reports the Treasury's cash infusions, only measuring the current gap between Fannie and Freddie's assets and liabilities. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/117xx/doc11705/08-18-Update.pdf\">update</a> to \"The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2010 to 2020,\" CBO adopts OMB\u2019s method of accounting for Fannie and Freddie costs for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. Starting in 2011, CBO reverts to estimating the subsidy cost of new loans and loan guarantees made by those two entities, adjusted upward for market risk. For 2011-2020, CBO estimates subsidy costs of Fannie and Freddie operations will be $53 billion.<a href=\"#footnote-78\" class=\"footnote\">78</a> Both CBO\u2019s projections of subsidy costs and OMB\u2019s and FHFA\u2019s projections of stock cash infusions are subject to assumptions about economic conditions, house prices and other variables.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"/housing/summary/\">Summary of Housing Sector</a> | <a href=\"/housing/summary/structure/\">Structure of Housing Sector</a> |  <a href=\"/housing/direct-expenditures/\">Direct Expenditures</a> |  <a href=\"/housing/tax-expenditures/\">Tax Expenditures</a> | <a href=\"/housing/regulations/\">Regulations</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Last updated March 30, 2011.</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\r\n\r\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>Subsidyscope analysis of data from the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/cr_supp.pdf\">Federal Credit Supplement (FCS) Fiscal Year (FY) 2010</a>.</li>\r\n\r\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>Subsidyscope analysis of data from the FHFA.

Although shelter is a basic necessity, the housing sector encompasses a wide set of economic activities affecting everything from financial markets to the demand for commodities such as lumber.  Through the use of subsidies, the federal government aims to reduce the cost of producing, purchasing or renting housing for households at a variety of income levels. These subsidies are distributed through dozens of programs, which provide grants, loans, tax expenditures or other incentives that support the construction of apartments, decrease the costs of mortgages and affect many other activities. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope estimates that the federal government spent $244 billion on housing-related grants and tax expenditures likely to contain subsidies in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a> The government also provided $4 billion in direct loans, and $688 billion in loan guarantees for housing-related activities, including guarantees of securities backed by loans already carrying a federal guarantee.  The ultimate subsidy cost of these loan and guarantee commitments is uncertain, as most are projected to be repaid by the borrowers and some federal sources project they may result in a profit to the government.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a> In addition, these estimates do not take into account administrative costs or market risk and are likely underestimates (see the discussion of Risk Transfers below). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government's role in the housing sector increased in fiscal year 2009, as it continued funding multiple programs enacted to address effects of the 2008 financial crisis. Notably, the government took conservatorship over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, assuming substantial liabilities in the process.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a> However, subsidy estimates for Fannie and Freddie vary based on whether the entities are considered to be on- or off-budget. For more on the costs of these and other federal actions related to the crisis, see the discussion of Risk Transfers below.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subsidy costs of housing loans and guarantee programs are uncertain and likely underestimates, and costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac vary widely. Therefore, Subsidyscope does not add them to grants and tax expenditures. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spending on housing programs that contain subsidies confers widespread benefits to homeowners and renters, as well as the construction sector, developers, realtors and more. Subsidyscope illuminates the budgetary costs of these programs; however, any use of these data for policy evaluation must weigh those costs against the benefits they provide.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope relies on multiple sources of government data to calculate these estimates. As <a href=\"http://subsidyscope.org/data-quality/\">previously noted</a>, these data may not include some types of subsidies, and may contain gaps that prevent allocating some published subsidy data to the housing sector.  All of these limitations can result in omissions of federal support that may, nonetheless, influence markets. However, they are the best data available, and they provide a baseline for comparing subsidies across economic sectors.  By publishing these estimates, Subsidyscope makes these data more accessible and their shortcomings can be more easily identified and, ultimately, improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Majority of $244 Billion in Housing Grants and Tax Subsidies Benefits Homeownership</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsidyscope divides federal support of the housing sector into four categories: direct expenditures (grants and contracts), tax expenditures, risk transfers (such as loans and loan guarantees) and regulations. Each of these categories is summarized in the sections below. This funding is administered through a variety of agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Federal Reserve. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government\u2019s housing activities can be further categorized into those that support rental housing, and those that support homeownership. As noted by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), \u201cmost of the federal government\u2019s support for housing is provided for homeownership.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a> Figure 1 below illustrates this, with 70 percent of the $244 billion in combined grants and tax expenditures going to homeownership activities.<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal support for rental activities is conveyed primarily through grant programs, while support for homeownership is conveyed largely through the tax code and other avenues (such as loans and loan guarantees). Of the $185 billion in housing tax expenditures in fiscal year 2009, about 8 percent, or $14 billion, was for rental activities. In contrast, $43 billion of the $59 billion in housing grants, or about 73 percent, was for rental activities. The remaining funding was for programs that support homeownership, or a mix of homeownership and rental activities.<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rental activities are generally targeted to households with lower incomes, as are some homeownership activities such as Rural Housing Service loans for single family mortgages.<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a> However, some of the government\u2019s largest housing expenditures are related to tax subsidies that are often used by higher income households, such as the mortgage interest deduction (MID) and the property tax deduction. These two programs cost an estimated $108 billion in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"charts floatr\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\r\n<h5>Figure 1: Housing Activities Supported through Grants and Tax Expenditures, FY2009</h5>\r\n<img src=\"/media/images/charts/housing/activities_supported_by_housing_spending.png\"><br /><br />\r\n<ul class=\"legend\">\r\n                    <li><span style=\"background-color: #bf5004;\"></span> Homeownership</li>\r\n                    <li><span style=\"background-color: #336699;\"></span> Rental</li>\r\n                    <li><span style=\"background-color: #33a991;\"></span> Mix</li>\r\n                    \r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<cite>\r\nSource: Subsidyscope analysis of FY2009 data from USAspending.gov and \" <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/spec.pdf\">Analytical Perspectives</a>.\" See: OMB. \"Analytical Perspectives Fiscal Year 2011.\" pp. 210-212. \r\n</cite>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Grants and Contracts: $59.1 Billion (FY2009)</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In fiscal year 2009, the federal government awarded $59.1 billion in direct grants to companies or organizations engaged in housing-related work, or about 8 percent of all grants the government awarded during that period. Subsidyscope deems all of these programs as likely to contain a subsidy, and, therefore, includes all of them in its analysis.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a> Federal housing grants were distributed through more than 60 active programs; about 73 percent of this funding went to programs that support rental housing. The largest grant program in the sector is HUD\u2019s Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. The program received $16.3 billion in fiscal year 2009\u2014about 28 percent of all housing grants.<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a> Click <a href=\"/housing/direct-expenditures/search/\">here</a> to search Subsidyscope\u2019s database of housing-related grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government spent another $0.3 billion on non-competed contracts for housing-related goods or services.<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a> Subsidyscope considers non-competed contracts as more likely to contain a subsidy component than competed contracts.<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a> Click <a href=\"/housing/contracts/search/\">here</a> to search Subsidyscope\u2019s database of housing-related non-competed contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tax Expenditures: $185.2 Billion (FY2009)</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The housing sector claimed $185.2 billion in federal tax expenditures in fiscal year 2009. This figure includes some of the largest tax expenditures in the U.S. tax code. The mortgage interest deduction, which allows homeowners to claim a deduction on their taxes equal to the amount they pay in interest on their mortgage and a home equity loan (up to $1.1 million in mortgage debt), cost the federal government $79.4 billion in lost revenue in fiscal year 2009. The vast majority, about 92 percent, of housing-related tax expenditures benefit homeownership activities.<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a> Click <a href=\"/housing/tax-expenditures/\">here</a> to read more about tax expenditures for housing, and <a href=\"/tax_expenditures/\">here</a> to explore Pew's Tax Expenditure Database. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risk Transfers: Increasing in Response to Financial Crisis</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government provides loans and loan guarantees in the housing sector, assuming financial risks that otherwise would be borne by investors or other entities. Through such \u201crisk transfers,\u201d the government has made a substantial financial commitment to the sector.  In fiscal year 2009, more than $4 billion was directly loaned to individuals or companies for the purpose of financing homes. Also in fiscal year 2009, federal agencies issued guarantees totaling $688 billion on loans for housing-related activities; this includes guarantees of securities backed by mortgages on single- and multi-family homes already carrying a federal guarantee. This loan guarantee amount is approximately three times the $230 billion committed in 2008; the growth was primarily due to increases in guarantees issued by the Federal Housing Administration and Ginnie Mae.<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the amount of loan and guarantee commitments illustrates the breadth of the government's role in the housing sector, it does not measure the subsidy costs that will ultimately be incurred. Most of these commitments are likely to be repaid by the borrowers. In fact, if subsidy rates calculated by the government according to the Federal Credit Reform Act are applied, the direct loans would be projected to cost under $0.3 billion, and the loan guarantees would be projected to generate over $1 billion in earnings for the government.<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a> However, these estimated subsidy rates do not include the costs of administering the programs or market risk (which arises from volatility in the economy)\u2014the main sources of the implicit subsidy of getting a loan with better terms than are available in the competitive market. Therefore, the government likely underestimates the subsidy.<a href=\"#footnote-16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a> For more information, see Subsidyscope's <a href=\"/housing/risk-transfers/\">risk transfers page</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In late 2008, the government took conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an effort to stabilize their declining finances; this was one of several steps taken by the government to bolster the housing market and the secondary credit markets which support it. The cost of conservatorship varies, depending on whether it is measured as federal outlays to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for stock purchases (off-budget), or calculated as the projected future costs of their portfolio at the time the government took on their liabilities (on-budget).<a href=\"#footnote-17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a> According to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the government provided a net $93 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in fiscal year 2009 by purchasing preferred stock from these two housing-related government sponsored enterprises (GSEs).<a href=\"#footnote-18\" class=\"footnote\">18</a> On a fair value basis, the CBO has estimated the subsidy cost of taking on their liabilities to be $291 billion in fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-19\" class=\"footnote\">19</a>  Federal agencies also purchased more than a trillion dollars of mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs, among other activities related to the government response to the financial crisis.<a href=\"#footnote-20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to analyze the extent to which some of these actions contain subsidies specific to the housing sector. Subsidyscope presents these activities in order to illustrate the government's role in this sector; these estimates should be used with caution as it may take several years to determine how much subsidy they will ultimately convey.

Unfortunately, there is no way to methodically identify and quantify these subsidies. Subsidyscope's regulations page describes some of the regulations that may create subsidies in the housing sector.

HUD maintains a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.huduser.org/portal/rbc/number\">Regulatory Barriers Clearinghouse</a>\u201d to address the consequences that regulations, such as those related to building codes and zoning rules, may have on the production of affordable housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once a home is occupied, property owners are responsible for operating or maintenance costs, many of which are initiated or changed by regulations. For example, regulations that affect utility prices can change the affordability of a home.<a href=\"#footnote-5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the ways in which homes are bought, sold or rented are often subject to regulation. In particular, regulations governing mortgage financing have the potential to significantly shape the housing sector in some localities.  In 2009, nearly 47 million homes, or about 61 percent of all owner-occupied homes in the U.S., had a mortgage on the property.<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a> As such, the ability to own a home is greatly affected by the rules governing banking and finance. Several examples of laws that include regulatory requirements that may affect the purchase, sale and finance of a home are discussed in detail below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>A Few Examples of Federal Housing Regulations</h4>\r\n  \r\n<h6>The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Encouraging Credit for those with Low- and Moderate-Incomes </h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is intended to encourage banks to address the credit needs in their communities, including those of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a> Under the CRA, banks must document the activities they undertake to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income constituents in their communities; these records are used by regulators in assessing banks\u2019 applications for opening or moving a branch or merging with another bank.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a> While originally enacted to meet perceived needs for house financing in inner cities, the CRA has evolved also to cover consumer and business lending, community investments and deposit services.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a> The four regulating agencies that implement the CRA are the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision. Each agency\u2019s implementing regulations can be found <a href=\"http://www.ffiec.gov/CRA/regulation.htm\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Congressional Research Service (CRS) explains, proponents of the CRA hold that it stimulates credit for those with low- and moderate-incomes, that it generates a significant amount of loans for home mortgages and small businesses in central cities,<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a> and that its costs are justified by the large community benefits it provides.<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a> In terms of the costs, CRA requires extensive paperwork and incurs other expenses on banking institutions.<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a> CRS also points out that some financial competitors of banks are not subject to CRA.<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years the CRA has undergone various changes. For instance, new rules promulgated in 2005 require banks to assess the outcomes or effectiveness of their CRA activities rather than solely evaluating whether they met \u201carbitrary targets.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a> In addition, in 2006, the regulating agencies issued guidance that discouraged subprime lending and offered help in mitigating \u201cthe subprime lending turmoil.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Home Mortgage Disclosure Act: Supporting Equal Access to Housing</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) notes that the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and the Fair Housing Act both generally \u201csupport equal access to rental housing and homeownership opportunities.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a> HMDA was passed by Congress in 1975 to provide public loan data by census tract. It allows assessments of whether financial institutions are meeting community housing needs.  HMDA data also helps public officials distribute public sector investments to areas where private investment is falling short, and allows for the identification of potential patterns of discriminatory lending.<a href=\"#footnote-17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Fair Housing Act: Prohibiting Discrimination in Housing</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fair Housing Act (the Act), originally enacted in 1968, prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, physical or mental handicap or familial status.  Many different activities are subject to the law, including selling or renting housing, making or purchasing loans, conducting appraisals and advertising housing to potential renters or buyers. The Act applies to almost every type of private and public housing, including apartments, mobile homes and rental housing owned by public housing authorities. However, there are some exceptions to the law, such as homes being sold by their owner and certain housing activities undertaken by religious groups.<a href=\"#footnote-18\" class=\"footnote\">18</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Act affects the housing market, though it is not always clear the extent to which these effects convey subsidies to producers or consumers of housing. Under the law, landlords are required to permit reasonable changes to a unit in order to accommodate persons with disabilities.<a href=\"#footnote-19\" class=\"footnote\">19</a> Further, any multi-family housing built after 1991 must meet certain design specifications that make them accessible and usable by those persons.<a href=\"#footnote-20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a> State and local zoning requirements are also affected by the Act, which prohibits such requirements from discriminating against group homes for persons with disabilities.<a href=\"#footnote-21\" class=\"footnote\">21</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to outlawing direct discrimination, the federal courts have agreed that some activities can violate the Act by having discriminatory effects, even if those effects were not intended.  An example of this is a practice known as \u201credlining,\u201d in which lenders avoid providing financing or insurance for homes because of characteristics of the neighborhoods in which they are located. The CRS notes that while redlining is \u201crarely intentionally directed at individual members of a minority group, [it] may have a disparate impact on such persons.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-22\" class=\"footnote\">22</a> Thus, courts consistently find this practice to be in violation of the Act.<a href=\"#footnote-23\" class=\"footnote\">23</a></p> \r\n\r\n<p>Housing discrimination complaints can be filed with HUD, and are investigated by its Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.<a href=\"#footnote-24\" class=\"footnote\">24</a> Civil actions can also be brought in state or federal courts.<a href=\"#footnote-25\" class=\"footnote\">25</a> HUD operates several programs, such as the \u201cFair Housing Initiatives Program,\u201d that assist local organizations in conducting outreach, training and enforcement of the Act.<a href=\"#footnote-26\" class=\"footnote\">26</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"/housing/summary/\">Summary of Housing Sector</a> | <a href=\"/housing/summary/structure/\">Structure of Housing Sector</a> |  <a href=\"/housing/direct-expenditures/\">Direct Expenditures</a> |  <a href=\"/housing/tax-expenditures/\">Tax Expenditures</a> | <a href=\"/housing/risk-transfers/\">Risk Transfers</a>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Last updated March 30, 2011.</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\r\n\r\n\r\n   <li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>See Section B.1 of Subsidyscope\u2019s <a href=\"/methodology/\">methodology</a> for a brief description of regulatory subsidies. Some argue that a government subsidy occurs when the government fails to correct problems through regulations resulting in certain goods or services being under-priced. For instance, they argue that a government\u2019s failure to adequately regulate peeling lead paint in apartment buildings results in a subsidy to landlords who don\u2019t maintain safe buildings. Subsidyscope does not take this approach. In practice, identifying and quantifying under-regulated market failures would be very difficult. </li>\r\n\r\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>Harrington, Winston, Lisa Heinzerling and Richard D.

Together, rental and owner-occupied housing encompasses a complex economic sector that contributed about 14 percent to the U.S. GDP in 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. government has long played a role in the availability and affordability of housing, intervening to support both supply and demand.  In the early 1930s, the U.S. began building multi-family housing projects for use by low-income families.<a href=\"#footnote-2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a> In addition, The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), created in 1934, gave middle- and low-income families access to mortgage markets and helped spur a broad increase in homeownership.<a href=\"#footnote-3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a> Today, government housing programs have expanded and evolved to provide and maintain housing and house financing options for people at a variety of income levels.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This page provides a broad overview of the structure of the housing sector, with a focus on the federal government's role in producing, purchasing or renting housing. The government\u2019s assistance to the housing market can be broadly grouped into three categories: rental housing, homeownership and block grants. Housing block grants are typically distributed to state or local entities with the discretion to determine the mix of rental and homeownership spending appropriate for their communities.<a href=\"#footnote-4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a> Each of these three categories is described in more detail below.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"subsidy-charts\" style=\"margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 30%; float:right;\">\r\n<a name=\"table1\"></a>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Characteristics of the U.S Housing Market in 2009</h5>\r\n<table style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"header-row\">\r\n  <td>Type</td>\r\n  <td>Units<br />(in millions)</td>\r\n  <td>Percent</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"even\"><td style=\"text-align:left;\">Occupied by Owner</td><td>76.4</td><td>59%</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td style=\"text-align:left;\">Occupied by Renter</td><td>35.4</td><td>27%</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"even\"><td style=\"text-align:left;\">Vacant Units</td><td>13.7</td><td>11%</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td style=\"text-align:left;\">Seasonal Units</td><td>4.6</td><td>4%</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"total\"><td>Total</td><td>130.1</td><td>100%</td></tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of data in the 2009 American Housing Survey.

Of these occupied units, approximately 32 percent were home to renters.<a href=\"#footnote-6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the federal government\u2019s initial activities in the rental housing market took place in the midst of the Great Depression. Programs like those enacted under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 were designed both to create jobs and to improve unsafe or unsanitary housing conditions.<a href=\"#footnote-7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a> The provision of decent housing, free of major physical problems related to heating, plumbing, electric or maintenance, remains a goal of many housing programs.<a href=\"#footnote-8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a 2008 report from the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the largest housing problem today is a lack of affordability&mdash;housing that costs less than 30 percent of family income.<a href=\"#footnote-9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a> In 2007, 8.6 million households lived in severely inadequate conditions or spent more than half their incomes on rent (described as \u2018renters with severe problems\u2019 in Figure 2 below)&mdash;about 24 percent of all renters that year.<a href=\"#footnote-10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a>  In that same year nearly 10 percent of rental units, on average, were vacant.<a href=\"#footnote-11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a></p> \r\n\r\n<p>The federal government employs a variety of programs to increase the supply of low-cost housing. In 2009, 73 percent of the $59 billion in federal grant funding in the housing sector went to rental programs; most of the remaining funding went to programs such as block grants that support both rental and homeownership activities (see Table 2 in Subsidyscope's <a href=\"/housing/direct-expenditures/\">direct expenditure page</a> for more information).<a href=\"#footnote-12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a> In 2007, these and other funds went to an estimated 5.2 million households.<a href=\"#footnote-13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"charts\" style=\"width: 800px; margin-left: 50px;\">\r\n<h5>Figure 2: Housing Conditions of Renter and Owner Households in 2007</h5>\r\n<img src=\"/media/images/charts/housing/structure_figure2.png\"><br>\r\n<cite>Source: Subsidyscope analysis of data from \"<a href=\"http://www.huduser.org/Publications/pdf/worstcase_HsgNeeds07.pdf\">Worst Case Housing Needs 2007</a>.\" See: David L Hardiman et al. HUD. pp. 55-56, Tables A\u20131a, A-1b. <br/>\r\nNote: HUD defines \u2018severe problems\u2019 as a rent burden that is more than 50% of income, or severely inadequate housing (serious physical problems related to heating, plumbing, electric or maintenance). 'Non-severe problems' are defined as a rent burden between 30% and 50% of income, moderately inadequate housing, or crowded housing.  \r\n</cite>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Subsidies to Renters</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal rental assistance primarily targets low-income households, defined by the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 as households that earn at or below 80 percent of the area median income.<a href=\"#footnote-14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a> Several programs are specifically directed towards households with special needs, such as the elderly or persons with disabilities. For example, <a href=\"/transportation/direct-expenditures/programs/385/\">Shelter Plus Care</a> funds programs that provide rental assistance payments to persons with serious mental illness or drug dependence.<a href=\"#footnote-15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a> In addition, funding is available for certain populations, such as veterans, Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, and renters in rural areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many rental assistance programs, including the well-known <a href=\"/transportation/direct-expenditures/programs/425/\">Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program</a>, generally provide subsidies to a renter or a rental housing project so that tenants do not spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent.<a href=\"#footnote-16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Subsidies to Developers of Rental Housing</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to subsidizing the rent paid by households for existing housing, the government also supports the maintenance and production of affordable rental housing. Through the 1950s, the federal government financed the construction of housing that was owned and managed by public housing agencies.<a href=\"#footnote-17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a> Though government-owned civilian housing is no longer produced, some projects continue to receive operational support and are home to roughly 1.2 million families.<a href=\"#footnote-18\" class=\"footnote\">18</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, the production of low-income rental housing has been incentivized through programs that lower financing costs for private or nonprofit developers.  Some programs directly lower costs through grants, such as the Section 202 program that provides funds to construct supportive housing for the elderly.<a href=\"#footnote-19\" class=\"footnote\">19</a> Other programs allow the developer to access below-market interest rates on loans, either through direct loans (for example, in the Section 515 program) or through loan guarantees.<a href=\"#footnote-20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a> Finally, tax provisions such as the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) or tax-exemption on housing revenue bonds provide incentives that ultimately lower the costs of developing affordable housing.<a href=\"#footnote-21\" class=\"footnote\">21</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In exchange for receiving assistance through these programs, developers are required to keep a certain portion of their rental units affordable to low-income renters.<a href=\"#footnote-22\" class=\"footnote\">22</a> In many instances these programs overlap, providing multiple forms of assistance to a single project; for example, LIHTC units are sometimes paired with Housing Choice Vouchers to make them affordable to tenants with very low incomes.<a href=\"#footnote-23\" class=\"footnote\">23</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the efforts described above, the federal government supports homelessness prevention through the creation and operation of emergency shelters, transitional housing and group homes.<a href=\"#footnote-24\" class=\"footnote\">24</a> HUD estimates that nearly 1.6 million people used an emergency shelter or transitional housing program during fiscal year 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-25\" class=\"footnote\">25</a> Although these homelessness prevention activities may not directly affect the wider housing market to the extent the other programs mentioned here do, they provide a platform from which otherwise homeless individuals or families can re-enter the housing market. </p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Rehabilitating Rental Housing</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>While the government supports the production of new rental housing, it also works to keep existing units in the stock of affordable housing.  It accomplishes this through programs that provide capital funds for rehabilitation or renovation of public or private housing units. For example, LIHTCs can be used to update and convert an existing building into a building with affordable units.<a href=\"#footnote-26\" class=\"footnote\">26</a> In addition, the HOPE VI program funds the redevelopment of severely distressed public housing, often replacing it with mixed-income communities.<a href=\"#footnote-27\" class=\"footnote\">27</a> As is the case when producing new units, developers using housing preservation funds are required to make a certain number of affordable units available to renters for a period of time after the rehabilitation is complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Federal Programs Promote Homeownership</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The term \u201chomeownership\u201d can refer to a variety of situations, such as one family that owns several homes; a person who owns a house, but rents another as their primary residence; or a person who holds a mortgage for a home but doesn\u2019t have any equity in the home. However, government assistance in the area of \u201chomeownership\u201d generally refers to a household which owns, or holds a mortgage for, their primary residence. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 112 million units of housing occupied in 2009, 76 million were occupied by their owner.<a href=\"#footnote-28\" class=\"footnote\">28</a> This contributed to an average homeownership rate in 2009 of about 67.4 percent.<a href=\"#footnote-29\" class=\"footnote\">29</a> Although homeowners are often thought of as living in detached single-family homes, homeownership can occur in a variety of structures. For example, in 2009 nearly 1.3 million homeowners lived in buildings with more than twenty units, and 5.4 million lived in manufactured or mobile homes.<a href=\"#footnote-30\" class=\"footnote\">30</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of owner-occupied homes in the U.S. have some type of mortgage on the property.  In 2009, only about 32 percent (or 24 million) owner-occupied homes were owned free and clear without a mortgage.<a href=\"#footnote-31\" class=\"footnote\">31</a>  For the same year, the Federal Reserve estimated that the amount of outstanding home mortgage debt in the U.S. totaled $10.3 trillion dollars.<a href=\"#footnote-32\" class=\"footnote\">32</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the majority of homes in America are now owner-occupied, this was not always the case. The federal government began to support mortgage financing in the 1930s to promote homeownership, bolster lending institutions, and spur the economy.<a href=\"#footnote-33\" class=\"footnote\">33</a> In 1930, the homeownership rate was about 48 percent; by 1950 the rate had grown to 55 percent.<a href=\"#footnote-34\" class=\"footnote\">34</a> This increase in homeownership was assisted, among other factors, by government policies that helped build a national market for housing credit through the creation of entities like FHA, the Federal Homes Loan Banks (FHLB) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae).<a href=\"#footnote-35\" class=\"footnote\">35</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the government continues to support homeownership and mortgage markets through a variety of programs, with the additional goal of extending credit to underserved populations.<a href=\"#footnote-36\" class=\"footnote\">36</a> While there is some grant assistance for homebuyers and homeowners, the overwhelming majority of government activity in this area focuses on the availability and affordability of mortgages. In fact, the largest housing subsidy reported by the government&mdash;the mortgage interest deduction (MID)&mdash;is a tax expenditure intended to reduce the costs of financing a home through debt. In fiscal year 2009, the MID lowered federal revenues by an estimated $79.4 billion. The MID and other activities are discussed further below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Grant Assistance to Homebuyers</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The government operates a handful of grant programs which help homebuyers obtain the resources needed to build or buy a home.  The Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program, for example, provides low-income households who contribute labor or \u2018sweat equity\u2019 with assistance in buying (or renovating) their home.<a href=\"#footnote-37\" class=\"footnote\">37</a> These grants are first awarded to nonprofits or other organizations, who in turn provide an average of up to $15,000 in assistance to recipient households.<a href=\"#footnote-38\" class=\"footnote\">38</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Widespread Government Efforts to Subsidize Mortgages</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The vast majority of assistance to homebuyers and homeowners is conveyed through the tax code and through support of mortgage markets.  For example, the First-Time Homebuyer Credit, first enacted with the 2008 Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA), encouraged homeownership by allowing a one-time tax credit of up to $7,500 to those buying their first home (it has since expired).<a href=\"#footnote-39\" class=\"footnote\">39</a> Many of these programs, like the MID mentioned above, are not specifically targeted to first-time homebuyers. Certain benefits, such as mortgage credit certificates derived from state sales of tax-exempt revenue bonds, are means-tested&mdash;allowing only low- or moderate-income families to participate.<a href=\"#footnote-40\" class=\"footnote\">40</a> However, the majority of tax breaks given to homeowners are based on the tax liability of the household, with some limitations. Thus, the higher the taxable income of the household, the more benefits they receive from the tax expenditure program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government operates multiple programs intended both to make mortgages more available and affordable, and to ensure liquidity in credit markets. The most visible of these are the government\u2019s loan guarantee programs run by agencies such as the FHA, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Rural Housing Service. These programs guarantee certain types of mortgages sold to first-time or lower-income homebuyers, providing homeownership opportunities to many who can only provide a low downpayment and for whom financing would be too expensive or out of reach.<a href=\"#footnote-41\" class=\"footnote\">41</a> In fiscal year 2009, the FHA alone insured more than 1.9 million single-family mortgages.<a href=\"#footnote-42\" class=\"footnote\">42</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another tool widely used to supply below-market interest rates to homebuyers are tax-exempt mortgage bonds. States use the proceeds of these bonds, which are exempt from federal income tax, to provide mortgages to homebuyers at reduced interest rates.<a href=\"#footnote-43\" class=\"footnote\">43</a> These loans are often made in conjunction with loan guarantees from programs like the FHA.<a href=\"#footnote-44\" class=\"footnote\">44</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government also funds direct loan programs, such as that run by the Rural Housing Service, which provide mortgages at below-market interest rates directly to homebuyers.<a href=\"#footnote-45\" class=\"footnote\">45</a> While less prevalent than federal loan guarantee programs, the government made about $4.1 billion in direct loan obligations in 2009.<a href=\"#footnote-46\" class=\"footnote\">46</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to supporting a supply of more affordable loans, the government devotes significant resources to ensuring liquidity in the wider mortgage market.<a href=\"#footnote-47\" class=\"footnote\">47</a> For example, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) are privately owned companies chartered by the government to purchase mortgages and to create and guarantee mortgage-backed securities.<a href=\"#footnote-48\" class=\"footnote\">48</a> According to the Congressional Budget Office, \u201ctheir federal charters have allowed the two entities to borrow at interest rates lower than those paid by comparable finance companies\u2026. The lower borrowing costs enjoyed by the two entities flowed to participants in the housing market in the form of lower mortgage rates and to the entities\u2019 stockholders in the form of higher profits.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-49\" class=\"footnote\">49</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the government placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship in order to stabilize their declining financial conditions.<a href=\"#footnote-50\" class=\"footnote\">50</a>  According to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) provided a net total of $135 billion to the through June 2010, with the cumulative amount projected to increase by a net $6 to $124 billion through 2013.<a href=\"#footnote-51\" class=\"footnote\">51</a> Other government agencies have also estimated the costs of taking on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  For more information about the costs of conservatorship, as well as other federal actions intended to strengthen the mortgage market and the wider financial market as a whole, visit Subsidyscope's <a href=\"/housing/risk-transfers/\">risk transfers page</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government support of the mortgage market is not limited to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Other federal efforts to ensure liquidity include the Federal Home Loan Banks, which loan funds to financial institutions to ensure the banks have adequate resources to provide mortgages.<a href=\"#footnote-52\" class=\"footnote\">52</a> In addition, the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) guarantees pools of mortgages that are issued or guaranteed by the FHA and VA.<a href=\"#footnote-53\" class=\"footnote\">53</a> For more information about these entities, visit Subsidyscope\u2019s <a href=\"/housing/risk-transfers/\">risk transfers page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Helping People Keep Their Homes</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government operates programs that provide counseling and other assistance to homeowners in order to avoid foreclosure (as well as other services for homebuyers or renters).<a href=\"#footnote-54\" class=\"footnote\">54</a> In 2007, federal foreclosure prevention activities began to increase in response to concerns over rising foreclosure rates.<a href=\"#footnote-55\" class=\"footnote\">55</a> These programs are broadly intended to help homeowners keep their homes through loan modifications that, for example, reduce the interest rates or the principals on mortgages.<a href=\"#footnote-56\" class=\"footnote\">56</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participation in these programs has varied.<a href=\"#footnote-57\" class=\"footnote\">57</a> For example, the HOPE for Homeowner program, which offers certain mortgage holders at risk of default the option to refinance with FHA backing, reportedly closed only 50 new mortgages in its first 9 months.<a href=\"#footnote-58\" class=\"footnote\">58</a> The program has since been modified, and it guaranteed $900 million in mortgages in fiscal year 2009 (see Table 2 in Subsidyscope's <a href=\"/housing/risk-transfers/\">risk transfers page</a>).<a href=\"#footnote-59\" class=\"footnote\">59</a> A report from HUD and Treasury on a selection of other foreclosure programs estimated that they began 3.5 million modification arrangements between April 2009 and August 2010.<a href=\"#footnote-60\" class=\"footnote\">60</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to counseling services, there are several programs which enable homeowners to renovate their homes.  For example, HUD administers multiple programs that help homeowners (and renters) minimize or remove health hazards, such as lead paint, so that residents can remain in their homes.<a href=\"#footnote-61\" class=\"footnote\">61</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Block Grants Support Homeownership and Rental Housing</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Although most federal housing grants are funneled to recipients through specific programs, the government also provides \u2018block grants\u2019 to states and local entities. Instead of dictating a specific use for each dollar, HUD block grants allow recipient governments to determine the best use of the funds according to the needs of their communities. Block grants such as the HOME Investment Partnership and Community Development Block Grants are allocated through formulas based on factors such as population size or need. In turn, those governments spend funds on priority housing needs (approved by HUD) and report the outcomes of their activities.<a href=\"#footnote-62\" class=\"footnote\">62</a> HOME funds alone provided subsidies for 307,000 rental units over a fifteen year period ending in 2007.<a href=\"#footnote-63\" class=\"footnote\">63</a>  Due to the flexible nature of these funds, Subsidyscope does not classify them as either rental housing assistance or homeownership assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"/housing/summary/\">Summary of Housing Sector</a> | <a href=\"/housing/direct-expenditures/\">Direct Expenditures</a> |  <a href=\"/housing/tax-expenditures/\">Tax Expenditures</a> | <a href=\"/housing/risk-transfers/\">Risk Transfers</a> | <a href=\"/housing/regulations/\">Regulations</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Last updated March 30, 2011.</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\r\n\r\n  <li><a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>Subsidyscope analysis of data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

The Treasury provides headquarters locations for the recipient institutions in the CPP information on its Web site, which is an attractive and readily accessible geographic indicator. However, using a bank's headquarters to map its reach is of questionable utility given that many financial institutions affect communities well outside of the state in which their headquarters is located. Unfortunately, many of the available maps rely solely on this indicator, including Treasury's Local Impact map.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A closer look at the Treasury map demonstrates the shortcomings of this approach. States with large financial centers are shown receiving a majority share of CPP funds while states without a significant banking presence receive little or no funds. For example, the entire state of Arizona is shown as having received only $2.5 million in CPP funds; Montana is shown as having received nothing. The lack of bank headquarters in these states may indicate an unequal distribution of funds under CPP; however, the high degree of disparity shown in Treasury's map is suspect. In reality, banks that have received TARP funds \u2014 although headquartered in other states \u2014 do engage in significant business in Arizona and Montana, a relationship not reflected in this map. As a result, this map and others use bank headquarters locations as an impact metric present a misleading representation of CPP funds distribution.*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While no mapping technique can perfectly capture the flows of money provided by the bailout,  Subsidyscope's alternative methodology uses government data sets to illustrate the geography of bank branch locations, deposits and lending activity. These three metrics for measuring the geography of banking activity offer a means for estimating the share of activity for a given bank within a specific region. We use the county (or county equivalent) as the core unit of geography though the underlying data could be interpreted at other levels of specificity (e.g. state or census tract). We also combine data for all organizations within a given ownership hierarchy such that the geography of subsidiary banking activity is reflected in the data for bank holding companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to calculate TARP impact using bank branches and deposits we collected a complete copy of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Summary of Deposits database (as of June 2008). This database tracks branch locations and deposits for all FDIC member banks as well as institutions regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision. From this data we determine the share of activity for a given location on an institution-by-institution basis or in aggregate for all TARP recipients. As might be expected, there is a strong correlation between branch locations and deposit shares; however, we provide both metrics for completeness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, we use data on home loan originations from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database from 2007 to track lending activity for a given institution. This data is merged using the Federal Reserve's Organizational Hierarchy database for HMDA reporting institutions. The geography of mortgage lending differs substantially from branch/deposit geography as many banks accept loan applications online or through local mortgage brokers. For example, Citigroup, which operates very few bank branches nationwide, issues loans in nearly every county through brokerage and online sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To download the data powering this visualization use the link below.  The file contains banking activity figures with county/state names and FIPS codes for integration with data sets such those provided by the Census Bureau.  The file is in CSV format, which can be opened with any modern spreadsheet program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"csv-link\" href=\"/media/data/tarp_cpp_banking_activity_by_county.csv\">Download CSV Data \u00bb</a></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnotes\" style=\"border-top: 1px solid rgb(211, 211, 211); margin-top: 50px; padding-top: 10px;\">\r\n\r\n<p>*It is also worth noting that the Treasury map suffers from data quality problems in addition to the methodological concerns described above. As of April 17, 2009, the map failed to reflect the full list of CPP transactions, including a $15 billion transaction for Bank of America issued on October 28, 2008.  As a result, the value shown for North Carolina is artificially low, showing a total for CPP funds received of $13.6 billion instead of the correct figure of $28.6 billion as of the date viewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\t\t\r\n", "locked": 0, "page": 1, "name": "text2"}}, {"pk": 8, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<div class=\"footnotes\">\r\n\t<p>Data Sources: Information on the TARP transactions is from the <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/eesa/tranche-reports.shtml\">Treasury Web site</a>.

Under the contract, the government will make money on the warrants only if the BAC's stock price exceeds $30.79.  Under the policy articulated by the press releases and term sheets, the government would have made money on the warrants once the stock price exceeded $25.94.  By setting a higher strike price, the government provides a larger subsidy to BAC.  However, given today's price for BAC stock (which was only $3.14 on March 6, 2009), the warrants have very little value regardless of the strike price.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Inconsistencies in the Treasury Department's description of the warrant program do not affect any of the subsidy estimates prepared by governmental organizations such as the Congressional Budget Office or the Congressional Oversight Panel, nor do they affect any of the subsidy estimates <a href=\"{% url tarp-subsidies %}\">presented on the Subsidyscope web site</a>. All of those estimates were developed using the strike prices in the actual signed contracts between Treasury and the companies receiving TARP funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, further analysis suggests that had Treasury used the alternative strike prices in the contracts, the aggregate subsidy costs of the TARP program would have been only slightly lower.  The warrants provide only a small fraction of the TARP subsidies; most of the subsidies are actually channeled through the government's purchases of preferred stock.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>For example, the BAC warrants account for about 3 percent of the total market value of the assets (preferred stock and warrants) that the government received from BAC.<sup>1</sup>  So, even if the terms of the warrants had been considerably more favorable to the government, the aggregate subsidies provided to BAC would have been only slightly lower.  Analysis of the warrants provided to other companies confirms this general conclusion.  On average, warrants account for only 4 percent of the total assets that the government received for the 10 largest TARP transactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Treasury's decision to use the date of application as the key date for determining the strike price probably makes more sense from an administrative perspective than using the date that the warrants are issued.  If the issue dates had been used, neither Treasury nor the bank receiving TARP funds would have known the exact terms of the warrant until 4 pm on the day before the contract was signed, which would have limited the amount of time that Treasury and bank staff had to review the terms of the contract.  More deals could have fallen apart at the last minute (which would have raised overall administrative costs of the TARP program), and some institutions might have been deterred from seeking TARP money, which would have undermined the goals of the program.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, inconsistencies in the documents that the Treasury Department uses to describe TARP to the public highlight a need for government officials to improve their communication about the program and reduce misunderstandings.  Miscommunications from the government have consequences: at least one bank relied on the Treasury's description of TARP program in its SEC filing and as a result, inadvertently misstated the terms of the warrants.<sup>2</sup></p> \r\n\t", "locked": 0, "page": 14, "name": "text2"}}, {"pk": 54, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p>In December 2008, <a href=\"http://subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/fdic/\">Subsidyscope </a> filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the names of all the banks participating in the program and the amount of debt guaranteed.

The remainder, it asserts, should be associated with ancillary businesses, depreciation and other direct costs, such as fuel and power, locomotive maintenance and call centers. Amtrak\u2019s ancillary businesses include contracted operator services to commuter trains around the country, such as the MARC in Maryland and Caltrain in California, many of which are buttressed through state and local funding sources. The ancillary businesses are actually a source of profit for Amtrak, bringing in $93.7 million in 2008.</p>\n\n<p> Click here to see Amtrak\u2019s <em><a href= \"http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobkey=id&blobwhere=1249200490219&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobheadername1=Content-disposition&blobheadervalue1=attachment;filename=Amtrak_0809monthly.pdf\">Monthly Performance Report for September 2008</a></em>.</p>\n\n<p>Subsidyscope took Amtrak\u2019s operating results as they appear in Amtrak management reports, which include depreciation and other overhead costs. The results were distributed evenly across all routes using 2008 ridership numbers; we divided Amtrak's overall operating loss by total ridership, arriving at $24.29 per passenger in additional losses. This figure is on top of Amtrak's reported profit or loss per route. See <a href= \"/projects/transportation/amtrak/table/\">this page</a> for details and our complete data set.</p>\n\n<p> Subsidyscope also analyzed route performance based on passenger miles traveled. Using this approach&mdash;as opposed to a per passenger calculation&mdash;and including the same overhead and depreciation costs, we found that Amtrak routes lose an average of 11 cents per passenger mile more than the railroad reports. When examined this way, four, rather than three, Amtrak lines appear to make money. The  Northeast Regional shows a loss of nearly $5 when examined on a per passenger basis but a profit of 2 cents  on a per passenger mile basis. Still, the line showed a substantially lower profit than the 13-cent-per-mile contribution Amtrak reported. The methodology and complete results for both calculations are presented <a href = \"/projects/transportation/amtrak/table/\"> here</a>. </p>\n\n<p> The differences between the two calculations performed by Subsidyscope show that route performance can be measured in different ways. Amtrak argues that it is not fair to include depreciation in assessing a route\u2019s financial performance. Due to a series of sale-leaseback transactions involving the company\u2019s equipment in the 1990s, depreciation values have been distorted, the railroad says.  An Amtrak official told Subsidyscope that ridership is the only factor that should be considered when calculating the profitability of any line. </p>\n\n\n<p>The GAO, however, found that not including depreciation caused an understatement of reported expenses for core and ancillary business lines by 19 percent and 15 percent, respectively. The GAO said information about depreciation is critical to any financial assessment because Amtrak relies heavily on its rail cars and other capital.</p>\n\n\n<p>In August 2009, the <a href= \"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/102xx/doc10294/08-06-BudgetOptions.pdf#page=113\">Congressional Budget Office</a> considered the option of reducing Amtrak\u2019s federal subsidy by about $200 million a year for five years. Amtrak officials and passenger rail advocates say this is impractical, noting that no passenger rail service in the world is profitable and arguing that Amtrak would cease to exist without the federal money. </p>\n\n\n<p><em>Last updated October 27, 2009.</em></p>", "locked": 0, "page": 52, "name": "text2"}}, {"pk": 121, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<div id=\"house_images\">\n<a id=\"de\" href=\"/nonprofits/direct-expenditures/\" title=\"Direct Expenditures\"><span class=\"hide\">DE</span></a>\n<a id=\"te\" href=\"/nonprofits/tax-expenditures/\" title=\"Tax expenditures\"><span class=\"hide\">TE</span></a>\n<a id=\"rt\" href=\"/nonprofits/risk-transfers/\" title=\"Risk Transfers\"><span class=\"hide\">RT</span></a>\n<a id=\"con\" href=\"/nonprofits/direct-expenditures/\" title=\"Non-competed Contracts\"><span class=\"hide\">con</span></a>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"sources-of-error\">Estimates rely on government data which can be inaccurate.

And they say the potential losses are never likely to be realized, because the banks intend to hold the securities to maturity. By then, spokespeople predict that the economy will have improved and their holdings will have recovered some or all of their value. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal Home Loan Banks already maintain a thinner capital margin than is typical for commercial banks, however. Because they have an implicit government guarantee\u2014investors believe the federal government won't let them fail\u2014they're able to maintain slimmer reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last fall, the FHLBs' private mortgage-backed securities had already run into enough trouble to raise concerns about capital levels. In January, Moody's reported that in the worst-case scenario, if their securities never regained their former value, eight of the 12 home loan banks would fail to meet capital requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Home loan bank representatives defend their smaller capital margin. As their 2008 combined financial report shows, the majority of FHLB assets\u2014about 70 percent\u2014are made up of advances, or loans to member banks. Those advances are extremely secure for investors: when a member institution takes out a loan, it must put up more collateral than the loan is worth. And the FHLBs are first in line to be paid back if a member bank fails. In fact, in their 77-year history, the home loan banks have never lost a penny on an advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Private mortgage-backed securities, however, don't enjoy these extra safeguards\u2014and they're much riskier than advances. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the measure that the FHLBs\u2019 regulator must use by law to determine if the banks are adequately capitalized may make them appear healthier than they are.  For example, the Seattle FHLB had only $960 million of capital on March 31, 2009, according to generally accepted accounting principles.  For regulatory purposes, however, the Seattle FHLB was allowed to state that its capital was almost $3 billion (see graphic below).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this review, Subsidyscope used the measure of capital that accountants use, in part because regulatory capital doesn\u2019t count the losses a bank suffered on its mortgage-backed securities and can be potentially misleading.  For example, the regulatory capital of the Seattle, San Francisco and Boston banks actually went up when accounting capital went down. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Article continues after graphic) </p>", "locked": 0, "page": 8, "name": "text3"}}, {"pk": 33, "model": "morsels.morsel", "fields": {"content": "<p>This analysis highlights a critical distinction between the funds disbursed to companies and the subsidies provided to them.

The individual FHLBs are used to a high degree of independence, so any bailout of one by the others is likely to be contentious and take time to resolve. The worry for taxpayers is that if the entire FHLB system still fell short of required capital, it might have to turn to Congress for extra funds. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is some evidence that confidence in the Federal Home Loan Banks among investors has eroded in recent months.  Subsidyscope has obtained information on the price of credit default swaps on FHLB bonds (see graphic below).  One way the home loan banks fund their loans to members is by selling bonds. Credit default swap prices are a measure of how expensive it is to buy insurance against the possibility that the FHLBs would default on their bonds.
