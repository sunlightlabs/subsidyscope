"The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) does not provide numerical data for values that are between -$50 million and $50 million. Rather it provides a footnote indicating that the values are either ""greater than -$50 million"" or ""less than $50 million."" The estimates in the individual and corporation columns from the JCT may contain values between -$50 million and $50 million (denoted as >-50 or <50). When aggregated, in the totals column, the sums of these values are unknown and thus are rounded to zero. For more information, see Subsidyscope's methodology."
