Expensing of certain capital outlays,,Agriculture,2000-2014,2000-2015,"The baseline tax system requires the taxpayer to capitalize costs associated with investment property. However, farmers may expense certain expenditures for feed and fertilizer as well as for soil and water conservation measures as well as other capital improvements under current law. </p>"
Expensing of certain multiperiod production costs,,Agriculture,2000-2014,2000-2009,"The baseline tax system requires the taxpayer to capitalize costs associated with an investment over time. However, the production of livestock and crops with a production period greater than two years (e.g., establishing orchards or constructing barns) is exempt from the uniform cost capitalization rules, thereby accelerating cost recovery. </p>"
Income averaging for farmers,,Agriculture,2000-2014,2000-2009,"The baseline tax system generally taxes all earned income each year at the rate determined by the income tax. However, taxpayers may average their taxable income from farming and fishing over the previous three years. </p>"
Treatment of loans forgiven for solvent farmers,,Agriculture,2000-2014,2000-2009,"The baseline tax system requires debtors to include the amount of loan forgiveness as income or else reduce their recoverable basis in the property related to the loan. If the amount of forgiveness exceeds the basis, the excess forgiveness is taxable. However, for bankrupt debtors, the amount of loan forgiveness reduces carryover losses, unused credits, and then basis, with the remainder of the forgiven debt excluded from taxation. </p>"
Accelerated depreciation of buildings other than rental housing (normal tax method),,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"Under an economic income tax, the costs of acquiring a building are capitalized and depreciated over time in accordance with the decline in the property's economic value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This insures that the net income from the property is measured appropriately each year. However, the depreciation provisions of the Tax Code are part of the reference law rules, and thus do not give rise to tax expenditures under reference law. Under normal law, however, depreciation allowances reflect estimates of economic depreciation. </p>"
Accelerated depreciation of machinery and equipment (normal tax method),,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"Under an economic income tax, the costs of acquiring machinery and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over time in accordance with the decline in the property's economic value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This insures that the net income from the property is measured appropriately each year. However, the depreciation provisions of the Tax Code are part of the reference law rules, and thus do not give rise to tax expenditures under reference law. Under normal law, however, depreciation allowances reflect estimates of economic depreciation. </p>"
Accelerated depreciation on rental housing (normal tax method),,Commerce and housing,2000-2013,2000-2015,"Under an economic income tax, the costs of acquiring a building are capitalized and depreciated over time in accordance with the decline in the property's economic value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This insures that the net income from the rental property is measured appropriately each year. However, the depreciation provisions of the Tax Code are part of the reference law rules, and thus do not give rise to tax expenditures under reference law. Under normal law, however, depreciation allowances reflect estimates of economic depreciation. </p>"
Amortization of start-up costs (normal tax method),,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2004,
Capital gains exclusion of small corporation stock,,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow deductions and exemptions to certain types of income. In contrast, the Tax Code provides an exclusion of 50 percent (from a 28 percent tax rate) for capital gains from qualified small business stock held by individuals for more than 5 years; 75 percent for stock issued in 2009 and 2010. A qualified small business is a corporation whose gross assets do not exceed $50 million as of the date of issuance of the stock. </p>"
Capital gains exclusion on home sales,,Commerce and housing,2000-2013,2000-2015,"The baseline tax system would not allow deductions and exemptions to certain types of income. In contrast, under current law, a homeowner can exclude from tax up to $500,000 ($250,000 for singles) of the capital gains from the sale of a principal residence. The exclusion may not be used more than once every two years. </p>"
Carryover basis of capital gains on gifts,,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow deductions and exemptions to certain types of income. In contrast, when a gift of appreciated asset is made under current law, the donor's basis in the transferred property (the cost that was incurred when the transferred property was first acquired) carries over to the donee. The carryover of the donor's basis allows a continued deferral of unrealized capital gains. </p>"
Credit for homebuyer,,Commerce and housing,2008-2013,2008-2011,"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code allows a tax credit for home buyers on purchases before May 1, 2010. </p>"
Credit for low-income housing investments,,Commerce and housing,2000-2013,2000-2015,"The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. However, under current law taxpayers who invest in certain low-income housing are eligible for a tax credit. The credit rate is set so that the present value of the credit is equal to 70 percent for new construction and 30 percent for (1) housing receiving other Federal benefits (such as tax-exempt bond financing), or (2) substantially rehabilitated existing housing. The credit can exceed these levels in certain statutorily defined and State designated areas where project development costs are higher. The credit is allowed in equal amounts over 10 years and is generally subject to a volume cap. </p>"
Deductibility of mortgage interest on owner-occupied homes,,Commerce and housing,2000-2013,2000-2015,"The baseline tax system would allow the write-off of expenses incurred in earning income. It would not allow the deductibility of expenses when income or the return on investments are not taxed. In contrast, the Tax Code provides that owner-occupants of homes may deduct mortgage interest on their primary and secondary residences as itemized nonbusiness deductions even though the value of owneroccupied housing services is not included in a taxpayer's taxable income. In general, the mortgage interest deduction is limited to interest on debt no greater than the owner's basis in the residence, and is also limited to interest on debt of no more than $1 million. Interest on up to $100,000 of other debt secured by a lien on a principal or second residence is also deductible, irrespective of the purpose of borrowing, provided the debt does not exceed the fair market value of the residence. </p>"
Deductibility of State and local property tax on owner-occupied homes,,Commerce and housing,2000-2013,2000-2015,The Tax Code allows owner-occupants of homes to deduct property taxes on their primary and secondary residences even though they are not required to report the value of owner-occupied housing services as gross income. </p>
Deduction for U.S. production activities,,Commerce and housing,2005-2014,2004-2016,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows for a deduction equal to a portion of taxable income attributable to domestic production. </p>"
Deferral of income from installment sales,,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2009,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates, or deferral of tax, to apply to certain types or sources of income. Dealers in real and personal property (i.e., sellers who regularly hold property for sale or resale) cannot defer taxable income from installment sales until the receipt of the loan repayment. Nondealers (i.e., sellers of real property used in their business) are required to pay interest on deferred taxes attributable to their total installment obligations in excess of $5 million. Only properties with sales prices exceeding $150,000 are includable in the total. The payment of a market rate of interest eliminates the benefit of the tax deferral. The tax exemption for nondealers with total installment obligations of less than $5 million is, therefore, a tax expenditure. </p>"
Discharge of mortgage indebtedness,,Commerce and housing,2008-2013,2007-2015,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from the income of a taxpayer any discharge of indebtedness of a qualified principal residence. The provision sunsets on December 31, 2012. </p>"
Exceptions from imputed interest rules,,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"Holders (issuers) of debt instruments are generally required to report interest earned (paid) in the period it accrues, not when paid. In addition, the amount of interest accrued is determined by the actual price paid, not by the stated principal and interest stipulated in the instrument. In general, any debt associated with the sale of property worth less than $250,000 is excepted from the general interest accounting rules. This general $250,000 exception is not a tax expenditure under reference law but is under normal law. Exceptions above $250,000 are a tax expenditure under reference law; these exceptions include the following: (1) sales of personal residences worth more than $250,000, and (2) sales of farms and small businesses worth between $250,000 and $1 million. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on life insurance savings,,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"Under the baseline tax system, individuals and corporations pay taxes on their income when it is (actually or constructively) received or accrued, depending on their method of accounting. Nevertheless, the Tax Code provides favorable tax treatment for investment income earned within qualified life insurance and annuity contracts. In general, investment income earned on qualified life insurance contracts held until death is permanently exempt from income tax. Investment income distributed prior to the death of the insured is generally tax-deferred. Investment income earned on annuities benefits from tax deferral. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on owner-occupied mortgage subsidy bonds,,Commerce and housing,2000-2013,2000-2015,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest earned on State and local bonds used to finance homes purchased by first-time, low-to-moderate-income buyers to be exempt. These bonds are generally subject to the State privateactivity-bond annual volume cap. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on rental housing bonds,,Commerce and housing,2000-2013,2000-2015,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest earned on State and local government bonds used to finance multifamily rental housing projects to be tax-exempt. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on small issue bonds,,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016," The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest earned on small issue industrial development bonds (IDBs) issued by State and local governments to finance manufacturing facilities to be tax exempt. Depreciable property financed with small issue IDBs must be depreciated, however, using the straight-line method. The annual volume of small issue IDBs is subject to the unified volume cap discussed in the mortgage housing bond section above. </p>"
Exemption of credit union income,,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"Under the baseline tax system, corporations pay taxes on their profits under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. However, in the Tax Code the earnings of credit unions not distributed to members as interest or dividends are exempt from the income tax. </p>"
Expensing of certain small investments (normal tax method),,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016," Under the reference law baseline, the costs of acquiring tangible property and computer software would be depreciated using the Tax Code's depreciation provisions. Under the normal tax baseline, depreciation allowances are estimates of economic depreciation. However, the Tax Code allows qualifying investments by small businesses in tangible property and certain computer software to be expensed rather than depreciated over time. </p>"
Graduated corporation income tax rate (normal tax method),,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"Because the corporate rate schedule is part of reference tax law, it is not considered a tax expenditure under the reference method. A flat corporation income tax rate is taken as the baseline under the normal tax method; therefore the lower rate is considered a tax expenditure under this concept. </p>"
Ordinary income treatment of loss from small business corporation stock sale,,Commerce and housing,2002-2002,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system limits to $3,000 the write-off of losses from capital assets, with carryover of the excess to future years. In contrast, the Tax Code allows up to $100,000 in losses from the sale of small business corporate stock (capitalization less than $1 million) to be treated as ordinary losses and fully deducted. </p>"

The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, current law allows qualified dividends to be taxed at a preferentially low rate that is no higher than 15 percent. </p><p>Capital gains exclusion for small business stock."
Small life insurance company deduction,,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016," Under the baseline tax system, corporations pay taxes on their profits under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. However, under current law small life insurance companies (with gross assets of less than $500 million) can deduct 60 percent of the first $3 million of otherwise taxable income. The deduction phases out for otherwise taxable income between $3 million and $15 million. </p>"
Special alternative tax on small property and casualty insurance companies,,Commerce and housing,2007-2014,2000-2016,"Under the baseline tax system, corporations pay taxes on their profits under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Under current law, however, stock non-life insurance companies are generally exempt from tax if their gross receipts for the taxable year do not exceed $600,000 and more than 50 percent of such gross receipts consists of premiums. Mutual non-life insurance companies are generally tax-exempt if their annual gross receipts do not exceed $150,000 and more than 35 percent of gross receipts consist of premiums. Also, non-life insurance companies with no more than $1.2 million of annual net premiums may elect to pay tax only on their taxable investment income. </p>"
Special rules for certain film and TV production,,Commerce and housing,2005-2009,2004-2016,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, under current law taxpayers may deduct up to $15 million per production ($20 million in certain distressed areas) in non-capital expenditures incurred during the year. </p>"
Step-up basis of capital gains at death,,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016," The baseline tax system would not allow deductions and exemptions to certain types of income. In contrast, capital gains on assets held at the owner's death are not subject to capital gains tax under current law. The cost basis of the appreciated assets is adjusted to the market value at the owner's date of death. </p>"
Empowerment zones and renewal communities,,Community and regional development,2000-2014,2000-2016,
"Exclusion of interest for airport, dock, and similar bonds",,Community and regional development,2000-2009,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest earned on State and local bonds issued to finance high-speed rail facilities and Government-owned airports, docks, wharves, and sport and convention facilities to be tax-exempt. These bonds are not subject to a volume cap. </p>"
Expensing of environmental remediation costs,,Community and regional development,2000-2008,2000-2016,"Under the baseline tax system, the costs would be amortized (or depreciated) over an estimate of the economic life of the building. This insures that the net income from the buildings is measured appropriately each year. However, the Tax Code allows taxpayers who clean up certain hazardous substances at a qualified site to expense the clean-up costs, even though the expenses will generally increase the value of the property significantly or appreciably prolong the life of the property. </p>"
Investment credit for rehabilitation of structures (other than historic),,Community and regional development,2000-2005,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. However, the Tax Code allows a 10-percent investment tax credit for the rehabilitation of buildings that are used for business or productive activities and that were erected before 1936 for other than residential purposes. The taxpayer's recoverable basis must be reduced by the amount of the credit. </p>"
New markets tax credit,,Community and regional development,2001-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. However, under current law taxpayers who make qualified equity investments in a community development entity (CDE), which then makes qualified investments in low-income communities, are eligible for a tax credit received over 7 years. The total equity investment available for the credit across all CDEs is $5 billion in 2009. </p>"
Recovery Zone Bonds ,,Community and regional development,2009-2014,2009-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In addition, it would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows local governments to issue up $10 billion in taxable Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds in 2009 and 2010 and receive a direct payment from Treasury equal to 45 percent of interest expenses. In addition, they would be allowed to allocate up to $15 billion in tax exempt Recovery Zone Facility Bonds. These bonds finance certain kinds of business development in areas of economic distress. </p>"
Tribal Economic Development Bonds,,Community and regional development,2009-2014,2009-2016,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code was modified in 2009 to allow Indian tribal governments to issue tax exempt ""tribal economic development bonds."" There is a national bond limitation of $2 billion. </p>"
Child credit,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific groups. Under current law, however, taxpayers with children under age 17 can qualify for a $1,000 partially refundable per child credit. The maximum credit declines to $500 in 2011 and later years. The credit is phased out for taxpayers at the rate of $50 per $1,000 of modified AGI above $110,000 ($75,000 for singles). </p>"
Credit for child and dependent care expenses,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2005,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, the Tax Code provides married couples with child and dependent care expenses a tax credit when one spouse works full time and the other works at least part time or goes to school. The credit may also be claimed by single parents and by divorced or separated parents who have custody of children. In 2009, expenditures up to a maximum $3,000 for one dependent and $6,000 for two or more dependents are eligible for the credit. The credit is equal to 35 percent of qualified expenditures for taxpayers with incomes of $15,000. The credit is reduced to a minimum of 20 percent by one percentage point for each $2,000 of income in excess of $15,000. </p>"
Credit for disabled access expenditures,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In contrast, the Tax Code provides small businesses (less than $1 million in gross receipts or fewer than 31 full-time employees) a 50-percent credit for expenditures in excess of $250 to remove access barriers for disabled persons. The credit is limited to $5,000. </p>"
Credit for holders of zone academy bonds,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016," The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Under current law, however, financial institutions that own zone academy bonds receive a non-refundable tax credit rather than interest. The credit is included in gross income. Proceeds from zone academy bonds may only be used to renovate, but not construct, qualifying schools and for certain other school purposes. The total amount of zone academy bonds that may be issued is limited to $1.4 billion in 2009 and 2010. </p>"
Deductibility of charitable contributions (education),,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures. In contrast, the Tax Code provides taxpayers a deduction for contributions to nonprofit educational institutions. Moreover, taxpayers who donate capital assets to educational institutions can deduct the asset's current value without being taxed on any appreciation in value. An individual's total charitable contribution generally may not exceed 50 percent of adjusted gross income; a corporation's total charitable contributions generally may not exceed 10 percent of pre-tax income. </p>"
"Deductibility of charitable contributions, other than education and health",,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures. In contrast, the Tax Code provides taxpayers a deduction for contributions to charitable, religious, and certain other nonprofit organizations. Taxpayers who donate capital assets to charitable organizations can deduct the assets' current value without being taxed on any appreciation in value. An individual's total charitable contribution generally may not exceed 50 percent of adjusted gross income; a corporation's total charitable contributions generally may not exceed 10 percent of pre-tax income. </p>"
Deductibility of student-loan interest,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system accepts current law's general rule limiting taxpayers' ability to deduct non-business interest expenses. In contrast, taxpayers may claim an above-the-line deduction of up to $2,500 on interest paid on an education loan. Interest may only be deducted for the first five years in which interest payments are required. In 2009, the maximum deduction is phased down ratably for taxpayers with modified AGI between $110,000 and $140,000 ($55,000 and $70,000 for singles), indexed. </p>"
Deduction for higher education expenses,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2002-2014,2001-2016," The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures. In contrast, the Tax Code provides a maximum annual deduction of $4,000 in 2009 for qualified higher education expenses for taxpayers with adjusted gross income up to $130,000 on a joint return ($65,000 for singles). Taxpayers with adjusted gross income up to $160,000 on a joint return ($80,000 for singles) may deduct up to $2,000. </p>"
Discharge of student loan indebtedness,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2005-2014,2004-2016," Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows certain professionals who perform in underserved areas, and as a consequence get their student loans discharged, not to recognize such discharge as income. </p>"
Education Individual Retirement Accounts,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Contributions to an education IRA are not tax-deductible. However, investment income earned by education IRAs is not taxed when earned, and investment income from an education IRA is tax-exempt when withdrawn to pay for a student's tuition and fees. The maximum contribution to an education IRA in 2008 is $2,000 per beneficiary. The maximum contribution is phased down ratably for taxpayers with modified AGI between $190,000 and $220,000 ($95,000 and $110,000 for singles). </p>"

Employer-provided child care credit,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2002-2014,2001-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Instead, current law provides a credit equal to 25 percent of qualified expenses for employee child care and 10 percent of qualified expenses for child care resource and referral services. Employer deductions for such expenses are reduced by the amount of the credit. The maximum total credit is limited to $150,000 per taxable year. </p>"
Exclusion of certain foster care payments,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Foster parents provide a home and care for children who are wards of the State, under contract with the State. However, compensation received for this service is excluded from the gross incomes of foster parents; the expenses they incur are nondeductible. </p>"
Exclusion of employee meals and lodging (other than military),,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016," Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, under current law employer-provided meals and lodging are excluded from an employee's gross income even though the employer's costs for these items are a deductible business expense. </p>"
Exclusion of employer-provided educational assistance,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016," Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. Under current law, however, employer-provided educational assistance is excluded from an employee's gross income even though the employer's costs for this assistance are a deductible business expense. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on bonds for private nonprofit educational facilities,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, under current law interest earned on State and local Government bonds issued to finance the construction of facilities used by private nonprofit educational institutions is not taxed. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on savings bonds redeemed to finance educational expenses,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Under current law, however, interest earned on U.S. savings bonds issued after December 31, 1989 is tax-exempt if the bonds are transferred to an educational institution to pay for educational expenses. The tax exemption is phased out for taxpayers with AGI between $100,650 and $130,650 ($67,100 and $81,100 for singles) in 2009. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on student-loan bonds,,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, interest earned on State and local bonds issued to finance student loans is tax-exempt under current law.

Exclusion of scholarship and fellowship income (normal tax method),,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016," Scholarships and fellowships are excluded from taxable income to the extent they pay for tuition and course-related expenses of the grantee. Similarly, tuition reductions for employees of educational institutions and their families are not included in taxable income. From an economic point of view, scholarships and fellowships are either gifts not conditioned on the performance of services, or they are rebates of educational costs. Thus, under the baseline tax system of the reference law method, this exclusion is not a tax expenditure because this method does not include either gifts or price reductions in a taxpayer's gross income. The exclusion, however, is considered a tax expenditure under the normal tax method, which includes gift-like transfers of Government funds in gross income (many scholarships are derived directly or indirectly from Government funding). </p>"

The amount of the credit that can be claimed is 25 percent of qualified wages for employment less than 400 hours and 40 percent for employment of 400 hours or more. Generally, the maximum credit per employee is $2,400 and can only be claimed on the first year of wages an individual earns from an employer. However, the credit for long-term welfare recipients can be claimed on second year wages as well and has a $9,000 maximum. Employees must work at least 120 hours to be eligible for the credit.

"Excess of percentage over cost depletion, fuels",,Energy,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would allow recovery of the costs of developing certain oil and mineral properties using cost depletion. Cost depletion is similar in concept to depreciation, in that the costs of developing or acquiring the asset are capitalized and then gradually reduced over an estimate of the asset's productive life, as is appropriate for measuring net income. </p><p>In contrast, the Tax Code generally allows independent fuel and mineral producers and royalty owners to take percentage depletion deductions rather than cost depletion on limited quantities of output. Under percentage depletion, taxpayers deduct a percentage of gross income from mineral production. In certain cases the deduction is limited to a fraction of the asset's net income. Over the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost of the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion offers more generous tax treatment than would cost depletion, which would limit deductions to an investment's cost. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on energy facility bonds,,Energy,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule.

These bonds are generally subject to the State private-activity-bond annual volume cap. </p>"
Exclusion of utility conservation subsidies,,Energy,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally takes a comprehensive view of taxable income that includes a wide variety of (measurable) accretions to wealth. In certain circumstances, public utilities offer rate subsidies to non-business customers who invest in energy conservation measures. These rate subsidies are equivalent to payments from the utility to its customer, and so represent accretions to wealth, income, that would be taxable to the customer under the baseline tax system. In contrast, the Tax Code exempts these subsidies from the non-business customer's gross income. </p>"
"Expensing of exploration and development costs, fuels",,Energy,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, the costs of exploring and developing oil and gas wells would be capitalized and then amortized (or depreciated) over an estimate of the economic life of the well. This insures that the net income from the well is measured appropriately each year. </p><p>In contrast to this treatment, current law allows intangible drilling costs for successful investments in domestic oil and gas wells (such as wages, the cost of using machinery for grading and drilling, and the cost of unsalvageable materials used in constructing wells) to be deducted immediately, i.e., expensed. Because it allows recovery of costs sooner, expensing is more generous for the taxpayer than would be amortization. Integrated oil companies may deduct only 70 percent of such costs and must amortize the remaining 30 percent over five years. The same rule applies to the exploration and development costs of surface stripping and the construction of shafts and tunnels for other fuel minerals. </p>"
Deductibility of nonbusiness State and local taxes other than on owner-occupied homes,,General purpose fiscal assistance,2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures.

In contrast, the Tax Code allows an R&E credit of 20 percent of qualified research expenditures in excess of a base amount. </p><p>The base amount is generally determined by multiplying a ""fixed-base percentage"" by the average amount of the company's gross receipts for the prior four years. The taxpayer's fixed base percentage generally is the ratio of its research expenses to gross receipts for 1984 through 1988. Taxpayers can elect the alternative simplified credit regime, which is equal to 14 percent (12 percent prior to 2009) of qualified research expenses that exceed 50 percent of the average qualified research expenses for the three preceding taxable years. Prior to January 1, 2009, taxpayers could also elect an alternative incremental credit regime. Under the alternative incremental credit regime the taxpayer was assigned a three-tiered fixed base percentage that is lower than the fixed-base percentage that would otherwise apply, and the credit rate was reduced. The rates for the alternative incremental credit ranged from 3 percent to 5 percent. The research credit expired on December 31, 2009. </p>"
Expensing of research and experimentation expenditures (normal tax method),,"General science, space, and technology",2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Research and experimentation (R&E) projects can be viewed as investments because, if successful, their benefits accrue for several years. It is often difficult, however, to identify whether a specific R&E project is successful and, if successful, what its expected life will be. Because of this ambiguity, the reference law baseline tax system would allow of expensing of R&E expenditures. In contrast, under the normal tax method, the expensing of R&E expenditures is viewed as a tax expenditure. The baseline assumed for the normal tax method is that all R&E expenditures are successful and have an expected life of five years. </p>"

In contrast, the Tax Code provides that owner-occupants of homes may deduct mortgage interest on their primary and secondary residences as itemized nonbusiness deductions even though the value of owneroccupied housing services is not included in a taxpayers taxable income. In general, the mortgage interest deduction is limited to interest on debt no greater than the owners basis in the residence, and is also limited to interest on debt of no more than $1 million. Interest on up to $100,000 of other debt secured by a lien on a principal or second residence is also deductible, irrespective of the purpose of borrowing, provided the debt does not exceed the fair market value of the residence. </p>"

Deductibility of casualty losses,,Income security,2000-2014,2000-2016,"Under the baseline tax system, neither the purchase of property nor insurance premiums to protect its value are deductible as costs of earning income. Therefore, reimbursement for insured loss of such property is not reportable as a part of gross income and uninsured losses not deductible. In contrast, the Tax Code provides a deduction for uninsured casualty and theft losses of more than $100 each, but only to the extent that total losses during the year exceed 10 percent of AGI. </p>"
Earned income tax credit  ,,Income security,2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific group. In contrast, the Tax Code provides an EITC to low-income workers at a maximum rate of 40 percent of income. For a family with one qualifying child, the credit is 34 percent of the first $8,950 of earned income in 2009. The credit is 40 percent of the first $12,570 of income for a family with two or more qualifying children. The credit is 45 percent of the first $12,570 of income for a family with three or more qualifying children. Low-income workers with no qualifying children are eligible for a 7.65 percent credit on the first $5,970 of earned income. The credit is phased out at income levels and rates which depend upon how many qualifying children are eligible and marital status. Earned income tax credits in excess of tax liabilities owed through the individual income tax system are refundable to individuals. </p>"
Exclusion of public assistance benefits (normal tax method),,Income security,2000-2014,2000-2016,"Under the reference law baseline tax system, gifts and transfers are not treated as income to the recipients. In contrast, the normal tax method considers cash transfers from the Government as part of the recipients' income, and thus, treats the exclusion for public assistance benefits under current law as tax expenditure. </p>"
Exclusion of special benefits for disabled coal miners,,Income security,2000-2014,2000-2016," Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. However, disability payments to former coal miners out of the Black Lung Trust Fund, although income to the recipient, are not subject to the income tax. </p>"
Exclusion of unemployment insurance benefits,,Income security,2009-2013,2009-2015,"The baseline tax system would not allow deductions and exemptions to certain types of income. In contrast the Tax Code was modified in 2009 to allow an exclusion of up to $2,400 of unemployment insurance benefits from gross income for taxable year 2009. </p>"
Deferral of interest on U.S. savings bonds,,Interest,2000-2014,2000-2016,
Deferral of income from controlled foreign corporations (normal tax method),,International affairs,2000-2014,2000-2016,"The United States generally taxes the worldwide income of U.S. persons and business entities. In contrast, certain active income of foreign corporations controlled by U.S. shareholders is not subject to U.S. taxation when it is earned. The income becomes taxable only when the controlling U.S. shareholders receive dividends or other distributions from their foreign stockholding. The reference law tax baseline reflects this tax treatment where only realized income is taxed. Under the normal tax method, however, the currently attributable foreign source pre-tax income from such a controlling interest is considered to be subject to U.S. taxation, whether or not distributed. Thus, the normal tax method considers the amount of controlled foreign corporation income not yet distributed to a U.S. shareholder as tax-deferred income. </p>"
Deferred taxes for financial firms on certain income earned overseas,,International affairs,2000-2014,2000-2016,"The United States generally taxes the worldwide income of U.S. persons and business entities. It would not allow the deferral of tax or other relief targeted at particular industries or activities. In contrast, under current law, financial firms may defer taxes on income earned overseas in an active business. </p>"
Exclusion of certain allowances for Federal employees abroad,,International affairs,2000-2014,2000-2016,"In general, all compensation received by U.S. citizens is properly included in their taxable income. It makes no difference whether the compensation is a result of working abroad or whether it is labeled as an allowance for the high cost of living abroad. In contrast to this treatment, U.S. Federal civilian employees and Peace Corps members who work outside the continental United States are allowed to exclude from U.S. taxable income certain special allowances they receive to compensate them for the relatively high costs associated with living overseas. The allowances supplement wage income and cover expenses such as rent, education, and the cost of travel to and from the United States. </p>"
Exclusion of income earned abroad by U.S. citizens,,International affairs,2000-2014,2000-2016,"Under the baseline tax system, all compensation received by U.S. citizens is properly included in their taxable income. It makes no difference whether the compensation is a result of working abroad or whether it is labeled as a housing allowance. In contrast to this treatment, U.S. tax law allows U.S. citizens who live abroad, work in the private sector, and satisfy a foreign residency requirement to exclude up to $80,000 in foreign earned income from U.S. taxes. In addition, if these taxpayers receive a specific allowance for foreign housing from their employers, then they may also exclude the value of that allowance. If they do not receive a specific allowance for housing expenses, they may deduct against their U.S. taxes that portion of such expenses that exceeds one-sixth the salary of a civil servant at grade GS-14, step 1 ($83,445 in 2009, which excludes regional pay adjustments). </p>"

Inventory property sales source rules exception,,International affairs,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The United States generally taxes the worldwide income of U.S. persons, with taxpayers receiving a credit for foreign taxes paid, limited to the pre-credit U.S. tax on the foreign source income. In contrast, the sales source rules for inventory property allow U.S. exporters to use more foreign tax credits by allowing the exporters to attribute a larger portion of their earnings abroad than would be the case if the allocation of earnings was based on actual economic activity. </p>"
Exclusion of benefits and allowances to armed forces personnel,,National Defense,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. As an example, a rental voucher of $100 is (approximately) equal in value to $100 of cash income. In contrast to this treatment, certain housing and meals, in addition to other benefits provided military personnel, either in cash or in kind, as well as certain amounts of pay related to combat service, are excluded from income subject to tax International Affairs. </p>"
Capital gains treatment of certain timber income,,Natural resources and environment,2008-2014,2000-2016," The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. However, under current law certain timber sales can be treated as a capital gain rather than ordinary income and therefore subject to the lower capital-gains tax rate. For individuals in 2009, tax rates on regular income vary from 10 percent to 35 percent, depending on the taxpayer's income. In contrast, current law allows capital gains to be taxed at a preferentially low rate that is no higher than 15 percent. </p>"
"Excess of percentage over cost depletion, nonfuel minerals",,Natural resources and environment,2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system allows the taxpayer to deduct the decline in the economic value of an investment over time. Under current law, however, most nonfuel mineral extractors may use percentage depletion (whereby the deduction is fixed as a percentage of revenue and can exceed total costs) rather than cost depletion, with percentage depletion rates ranging from 22 percent for sulfur to 5 percent for sand and gravel. Over the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost of the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion offers more generous tax treatment than would cost depletion, which would limit deductions to an investment's cost. </p>"
"Exclusion of interest on bonds for water, sewage, and hazardous waste facilities",,Natural resources and environment,2000-2007,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest earned on State and local bonds used to finance construction of sewage, water, or hazardous waste facilities to be exempt from tax. These bonds are generally subject to the State private-activitybond annual volume cap. </p>"
"Expensing of exploration and development costs, nonfuel minerals",,Natural resources and environment,2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system allows the taxpayer to deduct the depreciation of an asset according to the decline in its economic value over time. However, certain capital outlays associated with exploration and development of nonfuel minerals may be expensed rather than depreciated over the life of the asset. </p>"
Expensing of multiperiod timber growing costs,,Natural resources and environment,2000-2014,2000-2016,"The baseline tax system requires the taxpayer to capitalize costs associated with investment property. However, most of the production costs of growing timber may be expensed under current law rather than capitalized and deducted when the timber is sold, thereby accelerating cost recovery. </p>"
Investment credit and seven-year amortization for reforestation expenditures,,Natural resources and environment,2006-2014,2000-2000,
Social Security benefits for retired workers,,Social Security,2000-2014,2000-2016," Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. In contrast, the Tax Code may not tax all of the Social Security benefits that exceed the beneficiary's contributions out of taxed income. These additional retirement benefits are paid for partly by employers' contributions that were not included in employees' taxable compensation and partly by earnings on employee and employer contributions. Portions of benefits (reaching as much as 85 percent) of recipients' Social Security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits are included in (phasedin) the income tax base, however, if the recipient's provisional income exceeds certain base amounts. Provisional income is equal to adjusted gross income plus foreign or U.S. possession income and tax-exempt interest, and one half of Social Security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits. The tax expenditure is limited to the portion of the benefits received by taxpayers who are below the income amounts at which 85 percent of the benefits are taxable. </p>"
Deferral of tax on shipping companies,,Transportation,2000-2014,2000-2016," The baseline tax system generally would tax all profits and income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows certain companies that operate U.S. flag vessels to defer income taxes on that portion of their income used for shipping purposes, primarily construction, modernization and major repairs to ships, and repayment of loans to finance these investments. </p>"
Exclusion for employer-provided transit passes,,Transportation,2009-2014,2000-2016," Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. In contrast, under current law transit passes, tokens, fare cards, and vanpool expenses paid for by an employer or provided in lieu of wages to defray an employee's commuting costs are excludable from the employee's income. The recent stimulus legislation included a provision that equalized the transit subsidy maximum to that for employee parking expenses through the end of 2010. In 2009, the maximum amount of the exclusion is $230 (indexed) per month. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on bonds for Financing of Highway Projects and rail-truck transfer facilities,,Transportation,2006-2014,2005-2016,"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code provides for $15 billion of tax-exempt bond authority to finance qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities. The authority to issue these bonds expires on December 31, 2015. </p>"
Exclusion of reimbursed employee parking expenses,,Transportation,2000-2014,2000-2016," Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. In contrast, under current law employee parking expenses that are paid for by the employer or that are received in lieu of wages are excludable from the income of the employee. In 2009, the maximum amount of the parking exclusion is $230 (indexed) per month. The tax expenditure estimate does not include parking at facilities owned by the employer. </p>"
Tax credit for certain expenditures for maintaining railroad tracks,,Transportation,2005-2009,2004-2016,"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries.

Exclusion of GI bill benefits,,Veterans benefits and services,2000-2014,2000-2016,"Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. Under current law, however, G.I. Bill benefits paid by the Veterans Administration are excluded from gross income. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on veterans housing bonds,,Veterans benefits and services,2000-2014,2000-2016," The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule.
