Expensing of certain capital outlays,Expensing of certain capital outlays,Agriculture,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system requires the taxpayer to capitalize costs associated with investment property. However, farmers may expense certain expenditures for feed and fertilizer as well as for soil and water conservation measures as well as other capital improvements under current law. </p>"
Income averaging for farmers and fishermen,Income averaging for farmers,Agriculture,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally taxes all earned income each year at the rate determined by the income tax. However, taxpayers may average their taxable income from farming and fishing over the previous three years. </p>"
Exclusion of cancellation of indebtedness income of farmers,Treatment of loans forgiven for solvent farmers,Agriculture,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system requires debtors to include the amount of loan forgiveness as income or else reduce their recoverable basis in the property related to the loan. If the amount of forgiveness exceeds the basis, the excess forgiveness is taxable. However, for bankrupt debtors, the amount of loan forgiveness reduces carryover losses, unused credits, and then basis, with the remainder of the forgiven debt excluded from taxation. </p>"
Depreciation of buildings other than rental housing in excess of alternative depreciation system,Accelerated depreciation of buildings other than rental housing (normal tax method),Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under an economic income tax, the costs of acquiring a building are capitalized and depreciated over time in accordance with the decline in the property's economic value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This insures that the net income from the property is measured appropriately each year. However, the depreciation provisions of the Tax Code are part of the reference law rules, and thus do not give rise to tax expenditures under reference law. Under normal law, however, depreciation allowances reflect estimates of economic depreciation. </p>"
Depreciation of equipment in excess of the alternative depreciation system ,Accelerated depreciation of machinery and equipment (normal tax method),Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under an economic income tax, the costs of acquiring machinery and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over time in accordance with the decline in the property's economic value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This insures that the net income from the property is measured appropriately each year. However, the depreciation provisions of the Tax Code are part of the reference law rules, and thus do not give rise to tax expenditures under reference law. Under normal law, however, depreciation allowances reflect estimates of economic depreciation. </p>"
Depreciation of rental housing in excess of alternative depreciation system,Accelerated depreciation on rental housing (normal tax method),Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under an economic income tax, the costs of acquiring a building are capitalized and depreciated over time in accordance with the decline in the property's economic value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This insures that the net income from the rental property is measured appropriately each year. However, the depreciation provisions of the Tax Code are part of the reference law rules, and thus do not give rise to tax expenditures under reference law. Under normal law, however, depreciation allowances reflect estimates of economic depreciation. </p>"
Amortization of business start-up costs,Amortization of start-up costs (normal tax method),Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2004,"<p>Business start-up costs are costs incurred prior to the creation of an active trade or business that would be deductible if incurred in connection with the operation of an existing trade or business. If the start-up costs were incurred on or before October 22, 2004, a taxpayer could elect to amortize them over 60 months. For costs incurred after that date, a taxpayer may elect to deduct up to $5,000 of start-up costs, but this deductible amount is reduced (but now below zero) by the amount by which the taxpayer's total start-up costs for the year exceed $50,000. Non-deducted start-up costs incurred after October 22, 2004 are amortized over a 15-year period. The normal-tax method treats the 60-month amortized amounts and the deducted amounts as tax expenditures; the reference tax method does not.</p>"
Exclusion for gain from certain small business stock,Capital gains exclusion of small corporation stock,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow deductions and exemptions to certain types of income. In contrast, the Tax Code provides an exclusion of 50 percent (from a 28 percent tax rate) for capital gains from qualified small business stock held by individuals for more than 5 years; 75 percent for stock issued after February 17, 2009 and before September 28, 2010; and 100 percent for stock issued after September 27, 2010 and before January 1, 2011. A qualified small business is a corporation whose gross assets do not exceed $50 million as of the date of issuance of the stock. </p>"
Exclusion of capital gains on sales of principal residences,Capital gains exclusion on home sales,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow deductions and exemptions to certain types of income. In contrast, under current law, a homeowner can exclude from tax up to $500,000 ($250,000 for singles) of the capital gains from the sale of a principal residence. The exclusion may not be used more than once every two years. </p>"
Carryover basis of capital gains on gifts,Carryover basis of capital gains on gifts,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p> Under the baseline tax system, unrealized capital gains would be taxed when assets are transferred at death or by gift. In contrast, when a gift of appreciated asset is made under current law, the donor's basis in the transferred property (the cost that was incurred when the transferred property was first acquired) carries over to the donee. The carryover of the donor's basis allows a continued deferral of unrealized capital gains. </p>"
First-time homebuyer credit ,Credit for homebuyer,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,2008-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code allows a tax credit for home buyers on purchases before May 1, 2010. </p>"
Credit for low-income housing,Credit for low-income housing investments,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. However, under current law taxpayers who invest in certain low-income housing are eligible for a tax credit. The credit rate is set so that the present value of the credit is equal to 70 percent for new construction and 30 percent for (1) housing receiving other Federal benefits (such as tax-exempt bond financing), or (2) substantially rehabilitated existing housing. The credit can exceed these levels in certain statutorily defined and State designated areas where project development costs are higher. The credit is allowed in equal amounts over 10 years and is generally subject to a volume cap. </p>"
Deduction for mortgage interest on owner-occupied residences,Deductibility of mortgage interest on owner-occupied homes,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, expenses incurred in earning income would be deductible. However, such expenses would not be deductible when the income or the return on an investment is not taxed. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from a taxpayer's taxable income for the value of owner-occupied housing services but allows the owner-occupant to deduct mortgage interest paid on his or her primary and secondary residences as an itemized non-business deduction. In general, the mortgage interest deduction is limited to interest on debt no greater than the owner's basis in the residence, and is also limited to interest on debt of no more than $1 million. Interest on up to $100,000 of other debt secured by a lien on a principal or second residence is also deductible, irrespective of the purpose of borrowing, provided the total debt does not exceed the fair market value of the residence. As an alternative to the deduction, holders of qualified Mortgage Credit Certificates issued by State or Local governmental units or agencies may claim a tax credit of up to 20 percent of the interest expense. </p>"
Deduction for property taxes on real property,Deductibility of State and local property tax on owner-occupied homes,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, expenses incurred in earning income would be deductible. However, such expenses would not be deductible when the income or the return on an investment is not taxed. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from a taxpayer's taxable income for the value of owner-occupied housing services but allows the owner-occupant to deduct property taxes paid on his or her primary and secondary residences. </p>"
Deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities,Deduction for US production activities,Commerce and housing,2005-2014,2004-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows for a deduction equal to a portion of taxable income attributable to domestic production. </p>"
Deferral of gain on non-dealer installment sales ,Deferral of income from installment sales,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates, or deferral of tax, to apply to certain types or sources of income. Dealers in real and personal property (i.e., sellers who regularly hold property for sale or resale) cannot defer taxable income from installment sales until the receipt of the loan repayment. Nondealers (i.e., sellers of real property used in their business) are required to pay interest on deferred taxes attributable to their total installment obligations in excess of $5 million. Only properties with sales prices exceeding $150,000 are includable in the total. The payment of a market rate of interest eliminates the benefit of the tax deferral. The tax exemption for nondealers with total installment obligations of less than $5 million is, therefore, a tax expenditure. </p>"
Exclusion of income attributable to the discharge of principal residence acquisition indebtedness,Discharge of mortgage indebtedness,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,2007-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, all income would generally be taxed under the regular tax rate schedule. The baseline tax system would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from a taxpayer's taxable income for any discharge of indebtedness of up to $2 million from a qualified principal residence. The provision sunsets on December 31, 2012. </p>"
Exemptions from imputed interest rules,Exceptions from imputed interest rules,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Holders (issuers) of debt instruments are generally required to report interest earned (paid) in the period it accrues, not when paid. In addition, the amount of interest accrued is determined by the actual price paid, not by the stated principal and interest stipulated in the instrument. In general, any debt associated with the sale of property worth less than $250,000 is excepted from the general interest accounting rules. This general $250,000 exception is not a tax expenditure under reference law but is under normal law. Exceptions above $250,000 are a tax expenditure under reference law; these exceptions include the following: (1) sales of personal residences worth more than $250,000, and (2) sales of farms and small businesses worth between $250,000 and $1 million. </p>"
Exclusion of investment income on life insurance and annuity contracts,Exclusion of interest on life insurance savings,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, individuals and corporations pay taxes on their income when it is (actually or constructively) received or accrued, depending on their method of accounting. Nevertheless, the Tax Code provides favorable tax treatment for investment income earned within qualified life insurance and annuity contracts. In general, investment income earned on qualified life insurance contracts held until death is permanently exempt from income tax. Investment income distributed prior to the death of the insured is generally tax-deferred. Investment income earned on annuities benefits from tax deferral. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on State and local government qualified private activity bonds for owner-occupied housing,Exclusion of interest on owner-occupied mortgage subsidy bonds,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest earned on State and local bonds used to finance homes purchased by first-time, low-to-moderate-income buyers to be exempt. These bonds are generally subject to the State private-activity-bond annual volume cap. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on State and local government qualified private activity bonds for rental housing,Exclusion of interest on rental housing bonds,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest earned on State and local government bonds used to finance multifamily rental housing projects to be tax-exempt. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on State and local government small-issue qualified private activity bonds,Exclusion of interest on small issue bonds,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p> The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest earned on small issue industrial development bonds (IDBs) issued by State and local governments to finance manufacturing facilities to be tax exempt. Depreciable property financed with small issue IDBs must be depreciated, however, using the straight-line method. The annual volume of small issue IDBs is subject to the unified volume cap discussed in the mortgage housing bond section above. </p>"
Exemption of credit union income,Exemption of credit union income,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, corporations pay taxes on their profits under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. However, in the Tax Code the earnings of credit unions not distributed to members as interest or dividends are exempt from the income tax. </p>"
Expensing under section 179 of depreciable business property,Expensing of certain small investments (normal tax method),Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p> Under the reference law baseline, the costs of acquiring tangible property and computer software would be depreciated using the Tax Code's depreciation provisions. Under the normal tax baseline, depreciation allowances are estimates of economic depreciation. However, the Tax Code allows qualifying investments by small businesses in tangible property and certain computer software to be expensed rather than depreciated over time. </p>"
"Reduced rates on first $10,000,000 of corporate taxable income",Graduated corporation income tax rate (normal tax method),Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Because the corporate rate schedule is part of reference tax law, it is not considered a tax expenditure under the reference method. A flat corporation income tax rate is taken as the baseline under the normal tax method; therefore the lower rate is considered a tax expenditure under this concept. </p>"
Ordinary income treatment of losses from sales of small business corporation stock,Ordinary income treatment of loss from small business corporation stock sale,Commerce and housing,2002-2002,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system limits to $3,000 the write-off of losses from capital assets, with carryover of the excess to future years. In contrast, the Tax Code allows up to $100,000 in losses from the sale of small business corporate stock (capitalization less than $1 million) to be treated as ordinary losses and fully deducted. </p>"

Small life insurance company taxable income adjustment,Small life insurance company deduction,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p> Under the baseline tax system, corporations pay taxes on their profits under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. However, under current law small life insurance companies (with gross assets of less than $500 million) can deduct 60 percent of the first $3 million of otherwise taxable income. The deduction phases out for otherwise taxable income between $3 million and $15 million. </p>"
Tax-exempt status and election to be taxed only on investment income for certain small property and casualty insurance companies,Special alternative tax on small property and casualty insurance companies,Commerce and housing,2007-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, corporations pay taxes on their profits under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Under current law, however, stock non-life insurance companies are generally exempt from tax if their gross receipts for the taxable year do not exceed $600,000 and more than 50 percent of such gross receipts consists of premiums. Mutual non-life insurance companies are generally tax-exempt if their annual gross receipts do not exceed $150,000 and more than 35 percent of gross receipts consist of premiums.

Deduction for certain film and television production costs,Special rules for certain film and TV production,Commerce and housing,2005-2009,2004-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income.

Exclusion of capital gains at death,Step-up basis of capital gains at death,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p> Under the baseline tax system, unrealized capital gains would be taxed when assets are transferred at death or by gift. In contrast, capital gains on assets held at the owner's death are not subject to capital gains tax under current law.

Empowerment zones and renewal communities,Empowerment zones and renewal communities,Community and regional development,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income, tax credits, and writeoffs faster than economic depreciation.

"Expensing of environmental remediation costs (""Brownfields'')",Expensing of environmental remediation costs,Community and regional development,2000-2008,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, the costs would be amortized (or depreciated) over an estimate of the economic life of the building. This insures that the net income from the buildings is measured appropriately each year. However, the Tax Code allows taxpayers who clean up certain hazardous substances at a qualified site to expense the clean-up costs, even though the expenses will generally increase the value of the property significantly or appreciably prolong the life of the property. </p>"
"Tax credit for rehabilitation of structures, other than historic structures",Investment credit for rehabilitation of structures (other than historic),Community and regional development,2000-2005,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. However, the Tax Code allows a 10-percent investment tax credit for the rehabilitation of buildings that are used for business or productive activities and that were erected before 1936 for other than residential purposes.

However, under current law taxpayers who make qualified equity investments in a community development entity (CDE), which then makes qualified investments in low-income communities, are eligible for a tax credit received over 7 years. The total equity investment available for the credit across all CDEs is $5 billion in 2009. Under current law as of September 30, the credit expired on December 31, 2009. </p>"
Issuance of recovery zone economic development bonds,Recovery Zone Bonds ,Community and regional development,2009-2014,2009-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In addition, it would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows local governments to issue up $10 billion in taxable Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds in 2009 and 2010 and receive a direct payment from Treasury equal to 45 percent of interest expenses. In addition, they would be allowed to allocate up to $15 billion in tax exempt Recovery Zone Facility Bonds. These bonds finance certain kinds of business development in areas of economic distress. </p>"
Issuance of tribal economic development bonds,Tribal Economic Development Bonds,Community and regional development,2009-2014,2009-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule.

Adoption credit and employee adoption benefits exclusion,Adoption credit and exclusion ,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities. Instead, taxpayers can receive a refundable tax credit for qualified adoption expenses under current law. The maximum credit is $13,170 per child for 2010, and is phased-out ratably for taxpayers with modified AGI between $182,520 and $222,520. The credit amounts and the phase-out thresholds are indexed for inflation. Taxpayers may also exclude qualified adoption expenses from income, subject to the same maximum amounts and phase-out as the credit. The same expenses cannot qualify for tax benefits under both programs; however, a taxpayer may use the benefits of the exclusion and the tax credit for different expenses. </p>"
Credit for children under age 17 ,Child credit ,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific groups. Under current law, however, taxpayers with children under age 17 can qualify for a $1,000 partially refundable per child credit. The maximum credit declines to $500 in 2011 and later years. The credit is phased out for taxpayers at the rate of $50 per $1,000 of modified AGI above $110,000 ($75,000 for singles). </p>"
Tax credit for child and dependent care expenses,Credit for child and dependent care expenses,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2005,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, the Tax Code provides married couples with child and dependent care expenses a tax credit when one spouse works full time and the other works at least part time or goes to school. The credit may also be claimed by single parents and by divorced or separated parents who have custody of children. In 2010, expenditures up to a maximum $3,000 for one dependent and $6,000 for two or more dependents are eligible for the credit. The credit is equal to 35 percent of qualified expenditures for taxpayers with incomes of $15,000. The credit is reduced to a minimum of 20 percent by one percentage point for each $2,000 of income in excess of $15,000. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the Treasury tax expenditure ""Credit for child and dependent care and exclusion of employer-provided child care,"" found in the Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Credit for disabled access expenditures,Credit for disabled access expenditures,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In contrast, the Tax Code provides small businesses (less than $1 million in gross receipts or fewer than 31 full-time employees) a 50-percent credit for expenditures in excess of $250 to remove access barriers for disabled persons. The credit is limited to $5,000. </p>"
Credit for holders of qualified zone academy bonds,Credit for holders of zone academy bonds ,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p> The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Under current law, however, financial institutions that own zone academy bonds receive a non-refundable tax credit rather than interest. The credit is included in gross income.

"Excess of percentage over cost depletion, fuels","Excess of percentage over cost depletion, fuels",Energy,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would allow recovery of the costs of developing certain oil and mineral properties using cost depletion. Cost depletion is similar in concept to depreciation, in that the costs of developing or acquiring the asset are capitalized and then gradually reduced over an estimate of the asset's productive life, as is appropriate for measuring net income. In contrast, the Tax Code generally allows independent fuel and mineral producers and royalty owners to take percentage depletion deductions rather than cost depletion on limited quantities of output. Under percentage depletion, taxpayers deduct a percentage of gross income from mineral production. In certain cases the deduction is limited to a fraction of the asset's net income. Over the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost of the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion offers more generous tax treatment than would cost depletion, which would limit deductions to an investment's cost. </p>"

Exclusion of energy conservation subsidies provided by public utilities,Exclusion of utility conservation subsidies,Energy,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p> The baseline tax system generally takes a comprehensive view of taxable income that includes a wide variety of (measurable) accretions to wealth. In certain circumstances, public utilities offer rate subsidies to non-business customers who invest in energy conservation measures. These rate subsidies are equivalent to payments from the utility to its customer, and so represent accretions to wealth, income, that would be taxable to the customer under the baseline tax system. In contrast, the Tax Code exempts these subsidies from the non-business customer's gross income. </p>"
"Expensing of exploration and development costs, fuels","Expensing of exploration and development costs, fuels",Energy,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, the costs of exploring and developing oil and gas wells would be capitalized and then amortized (or depreciated) over an estimate of the economic life of the well. This insures that the net income from the well is measured appropriately each year. In contrast to this treatment, current law allows intangible drilling costs for successful investments in domestic oil and gas wells (such as wages, the cost of using machinery for grading and drilling, and the cost of unsalvageable materials used in constructing wells) to be deducted immediately, i.e., expensed. Because it allows recovery of costs sooner, expensing is more generous for the taxpayer than would be amortization. Integrated oil companies may deduct only 70 percent of such costs and must amortize the remaining 30 percent over five years. The same rule applies to the exploration and development costs of surface stripping and the construction of shafts and tunnels for other fuel minerals. </p>"

"Deduction of nonbusiness State and local government income taxes, sales taxes, and personal property taxes",Deductibility of nonbusiness State and local taxes other than on owner-occupied homes,General purpose fiscal assistance,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, a deduction for personal consumption expenditures would not be allowed. In contrast, the Tax Code allows taxpayers who itemize their deductions to claim a deduction for State and local income taxes (or, at the taxpayer's election, state and local sales taxes) and property taxes, even though these taxes primarily pay for services that, if purchased directly by taxpayers, would not be deductible. </p>"
Exclusion of interest on public purpose State and local government bonds,Exclusion of interest on public purpose State and local bonds,General purpose fiscal assistance,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, under current law interest earned on State and local government bonds issued to finance public-purpose construction (e.g., schools, roads, sewers), equipment acquisition, and other public purposes is tax-exempt. Interest on bonds issued by Indian tribal governments for essential governmental purposes is also tax-exempt. </p>"

Credit for increasing research activities (section 41),Credit for increasing research activities,"General science, space, and technology",2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an R&E credit of 20 percent of qualified research expenditures in excess of a base amount.The base amount is generally determined by multiplying a ""fixed-base percentage"" by the average amount of the company's gross receipts for the prior four years. The taxpayer's fixed base percentage generally is the ratio of its research expenses to gross receipts for 1984 through 1988. Taxpayers can elect the alternative simplified credit regime, which is equal to 14 percent (12 percent prior to 2009) of qualified research expenses that exceed 50 percent of the average qualified research expenses for the three preceding taxable years. Prior to January 1, 2009, taxpayers could also elect an alternative incremental credit regime. Under the alternative incremental credit regime the taxpayer was assigned a three-tiered fixed base percentage that is lower than the fixed-base percentage that would otherwise apply, and the credit rate was reduced. The rates for the alternative incremental credit ranged from 3 percent to 5 percent. Under current law as of September 30, the research credit expired on December 31, 2009. </p>"
Expensing of research and experimental expenditures,Expensing of research and experimentation expenditures (normal tax method),"General science, space, and technology",2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Research and experimentation (R&E) projects can be viewed as investments because, if successful, their benefits accrue for several years. It is often difficult, however, to identify whether a specific R&E project is successful and, if successful, what its expected life will be. Because of this ambiguity, the reference law baseline tax system would allow of expensing of R&E expenditures. In contrast, under the normal tax method, the expensing of R&E expenditures is viewed as a tax expenditure. The baseline assumed for the normal tax method is that all R&E expenditures are successful and have an expected life of five years. </p>"
Tax credit for small businesses purchasing employer insurance,Credit for employee health insurance expenses of small business ,Health,2010-2014,2010-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, the Tax Code provides a tax credit to qualified small employers that make a certain level of non-elective contributions towards the purchase of certain health insurance coverage for its employees. To receive a credit, an employer must have fewer than 25 full-time-equivalent employees whose average annual full-time-equivalent wages from the employer are less than $50,000 (indexed for taxable years after 2013). However, to receive a full credit, an employer must have no more than 10 full-time employees, and the average wage paid to these employees must be no more than $25,000 (indexed for taxable years after 2013). A qualifying employer may claim the credit for any taxable year beginning in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 and for up to two years for insurance purchased through a Health Insurance Exchange thereafter. For taxable years beginning in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, the maximum credit is 35 percent of premiums paid by qualified taxable employers and 25 percent of premiums paid by qualified tax-exempt organizations. For taxable years beginning in 2014 and later years, the maximum tax credit will increase to 50 percent of premiums paid by qualified taxable employers and 35 percent of premiums paid by qualified tax-exempt organizations. </p>"

For tax years beginning after 2012, only medical expenditures exceeding 10 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income are deductible. However, for the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, if either the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse turns 65 before the end of the taxable year, the threshold remains at 7.5 percent of adjusted income. </p>"

Health savings accounts,Medical Savings Accounts / Health Savings Accounts,Health,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. Also, the baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures. In contrast, individual contributions to Archer Medical Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are allowed as a deduction in determining adjusted gross income whether or not the individual itemizes deductions. Employer contributions to Archer MSAs and HSAs are excluded from income and employment taxes. Archer MSAs and HSAs require that the individual have coverage by a qualifying high deductible health plan. Earnings from the accounts are excluded from taxable income. Distributions from the accounts used for medical expenses are not taxable. The rules for HSAs are generally more flexible than for Archer MSAs and the deductible contribution amounts are greater (in 2010, $3050 for taxpayers with individual coverage and $6,150 for taxpayers with family coverage). Thus, HSAs have largely replaced MSAs. </p>"
Credits and subsidies for participation in exchanges ,Refundable Premium Assistance Tax Credit ,Health,2010-2014,2010-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, for taxable years ending after 2013, the Tax Code provides a premium assistance credit to any eligible taxpayer for any qualified health insurance purchased through a Health Insurance Exchange. In general, an eligible taxpayer is a taxpayer with annual household income between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level for a family of the taxpayer's size and that does not have access to affordable minimum essential health care coverage. The amount of the credit equals the lesser of (i) the actual premiums paid by the taxpayer for such coverage or (ii) the difference between the cost of a statutorily-identified benchmark plan offered on the exchange and a required payment by the taxpayer that increases with income. </p>"

Deferral of active income of controlled foreign corporations,Deferral of income from controlled foreign corporations (normal tax method),International affairs,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The United States generally taxes the worldwide income of U.S. persons and business entities. In contrast, certain active income of foreign corporations controlled by U.S. shareholders is not subject to U.S. taxation when it is earned. The income becomes taxable only when the controlling U.S. shareholders receive dividends or other distributions from their foreign stockholding. The reference law tax baseline reflects this tax treatment where only realized income is taxed. Under the normal tax method, however, the currently attributable foreign source pre-tax income from such a controlling interest is considered to be subject to U.S. taxation, whether or not distributed. Thus, the normal tax method considers the amount of controlled foreign corporation income not yet distributed to a U.S. shareholder as tax-deferred income. </p>"

It makes no difference whether the compensation is a result of working abroad or whether it is labeled as an allowance for the high cost of living abroad. In contrast to this treatment, U.S. Federal civilian employees and Peace Corps members who work outside the continental United States are allowed to exclude from U.S. taxable income certain special allowances they receive to compensate them for the relatively high costs associated with living overseas.

In contrast to this treatment, U.S. tax law allows U.S. citizens who live abroad, work in the private sector, and satisfy a foreign residency requirement to exclude up to $80,000 in foreign earned income from U.S. taxes. In addition, if these taxpayers receive a specific allowance for foreign housing from their employers, then they may also exclude the value of that allowance.

It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. However, under current law certain timber sales can be treated as a capital gain rather than ordinary income and therefore subject to the lower capital-gains tax rate. For individuals in 2010, tax rates on regular income vary from 10 percent to 35 percent, depending on the taxpayer's income. In contrast, current law allows capital gains to be taxed at a preferentially low rate that is no higher than 15 percent. </p>"
"Excess of percentage over cost depletion, nonfuel minerals","Excess of percentage over cost depletion, nonfuel minerals",Natural resources and environment,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system allows the taxpayer to deduct the decline in the economic value of an investment over time. Under current law, however, most nonfuel mineral extractors may use percentage depletion (whereby the deduction is fixed as a percentage of revenue and can exceed total costs) rather than cost depletion, with percentage depletion rates ranging from 22 percent for sulfur to 5 percent for sand and gravel. Over the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost of the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion offers more generous tax treatment than would cost depletion, which would limit deductions to an investment's cost. </p>"
"Exclusion of interest on State and local government qualified private activity bonds for sewage, water, and hazardous waste facilities","Exclusion of interest on bonds for water, sewage, and hazardous waste facilities",Natural resources and environment,2000-2007,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest earned on State and local bonds used to finance construction of sewage, water, or hazardous waste facilities to be exempt from tax. These bonds are generally subject to the State private-activity-bond annual volume cap.</p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the JCT tax expenditure ""Exclusion of interest on State and local government qualified private activity bonds for sewage, water, and hazardous waste facilities,"" found in the Community and Regional Development Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
"Expensing of exploration and development costs, nonfuel minerals","Expensing of exploration and development costs, nonfuel minerals",Natural resources and environment,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system allows the taxpayer to deduct the depreciation of an asset according to the decline in its economic value over time. However, certain capital outlays associated with exploration and development of nonfuel minerals may be expensed rather than depreciated over the life of the asset. </p>"
Expensing of timber-growing costs,Expensing of multiperiod timber growing costs,Natural resources and environment,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system requires the taxpayer to capitalize costs associated with investment property. However, most of the production costs of growing timber may be expensed under current law rather than capitalized and deducted when the timber is sold, thereby accelerating cost recovery. </p>"
Exclusion of untaxed Social Security and railroad retirement benefits,Social Security benefits for retired workers,Social Security,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p> Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, would be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. Thus, the portion of Social Security benefits that is attributable to employer contributions and earnings on employer and employee contributions (and not attributable to employee contributions) would be subject to tax. In contrast, the Tax Code may not tax all of the Social Security benefits that exceed the beneficiary's contributions from previously taxed income. Actuarially, previously taxed contributions generally do not exceed 15 percent of benefits, even for retirees receiving the highest levels of benefits. Up to 85 percent of recipients' Social Security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits are included in (phased into) the income tax base if the recipient's provisional income exceeds certain base amounts. (Provisional income is equal to other items included in adjusted gross income plus foreign or U.S. possession income, tax-exempt interest, and one half of Social Security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits.) The untaxed portion of the benefits received by taxpayers who are below the income amounts at which 85 percent of the benefits are taxable is counted as a tax expenditure. </p>"
Deferral of tax on capital construction funds of shipping companies,Deferral of tax on shipping companies,Transportation,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p> The baseline tax system generally would tax all profits and income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows certain companies that operate U.S. flag vessels to defer income taxes on that portion of their income used for shipping purposes, primarily construction, modernization and major repairs to ships, and repayment of loans to finance these investments. </p>"
Exclusion of employer-provided transit and vanpool benefits,Exclusion for employer-provided transit passes,Transportation,2009-2014,2000-2016,"<p> Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, would be included in taxable income. Dedicated payments and in-kind benefits represent accretions to wealth that do not differ materially from cash wages. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from a taxpayer's taxable income for passes, tokens, fare cards, and vanpool expenses that are paid for by an employer or that are received by the employee in lieu of wages to defray an employee's commuting costs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (""ARRA,"" Pub. L. 111-5) included a provision that equalized the maximum exclusion amount for these expenses with the maximum exclusion amount for employee parking expenses. In 2010, the maximum amount of the exclusion is $230 per month. Under current law as of September 30, this provision of the ARRA expired on December 31, 2010. </p>"

It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code provides for $15 billion of tax-exempt bond authority to finance qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities. The authority to issue these bonds expires on December 31, 2015. </p>"
Exclusion of employer-paid transportation benefits,Exclusion of reimbursed employee parking expenses,Transportation,2000-2014,2000-2016,"<p> Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, would be included in taxable income.

In 2010, the maximum amount of the parking exclusion is $230 per month. The tax expenditure estimate does not include any subsidy provided through employer-owned parking facilities. </p>"
Credit for certain expenditures on railroad track maintenance,Tax credit for certain expenditures for maintaining railroad tracks,Transportation,2005-2009,2004-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. However, under current law eligible taxpayers may claim a credit equal to the lesser of 50 percent of maintenance expenditures and the product of $3,500 and the number of miles of track owned or leased. Under current law as of September 30, the credit expired on December 31, 2009. </p>"
