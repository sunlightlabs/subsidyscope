Cash accounting for agriculture,Agriculture,2000-2009,"<p>Most farm businesses (with the exception of certain farm corporations and partnerships or any tax shelter operation) may use the cash method of tax accounting to deduct costs attributable to goods held for sale and in inventory at the end of the tax year. These businesses are also allowed to expense some costs of developing assets that will produce income in future years. Both of these rules thus allow deductions to be claimed before the income associated with the deductions is realized.</p>

<p>Costs that may be deducted before income attributable to them is realized include livestock feed and the expenses of planting crops for succeeding years harvest. Costs that otherwise would be considered capital
expenditures but that may be deducted immediately by farmers include certain soil and water conservation expenses, costs associated with raising dairy and breeding cattle, and fertilizer and soil conditioner costs.</p>
"
Exclusion of cost-sharing payments,Agriculture,2000-2014,"<p>There are a number of programs under which both the federal and state governments make payments to taxpayers which represent a share of the cost of certain improvements made to the land. These programs generally relate to improvements which further conservation, protect the environment, improve forests, or provide habitats for wildlife. Under Section 126, the grants received under certain of these programs are excluded from the recipients gross income.</p>

<p>To qualify for the exclusion, the payment must be made primarily for the purpose of conserving soil and water resources or protecting the environment, and the payment must not produce a substantial increase in the annual income from the property with respect to which the payment was made.</p>
"
Five-year carryback period for net operating losses attributable to farming,Agriculture,2000-2014,"<p>A net operating loss, the amount by which business and certain other expenses exceed income for the year, may be carried forward and deducted from other income for 20 years following the loss year. It may, at the taxpayers election, instead be carried back to earlier years in which there was positive income. For most taxpayers, the carry back period is limited to the previous two years, although small businesses in federally declared disaster areas may carry losses back three years.. Current law permits losses attributed to a farming business (as defined in section 263A(e)(4)) to be carried back five years. The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 broadened the definition of farm income to include losses on qualified timber property located in the Gulf or Rita Opportunity Zones.</p>"
Five-year recovery period for certain farming business machinery or equipment,Agriculture,2009-2013,"<p>There is no definition available for this tax expenditure in the 2006, 2008, or 2010 Congressional Research Service's <em>Tax Expenditures: Compendium of Background Material on Individual Provisions</em>.</p>"
15-year recovery period for retail motor fuels outlets,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>Taxpayers are allowed to deduct the costs of acquiring depreciable assets (assets that wear out or become obsolete over a period of years) as depreciation deductions. The tax code currently allows new buildings other than rental housing to be written off over 39 years, using a straight line method where equal amounts are deducted in each period. There is also a prescribed 40 year write-off period for these buildings under the alternative minimum tax (also based on a straight-line method).</p>

<p>Motorsports complexes (tracks and other land improvements and support facilities) are depreciated over seven years using a double declining balance method (where a rate twice as large as straight line is applied to the undepreciated balance, with a switch to straight line midway through the period). About half the revenue cost is due to the special provisions, primarily the treatment of leasehold improvements. These provisions are included in the extenders provisions, which are usually extended each year.</p>
"
5-year carryback of general business credits,Commerce and housing,2010-2014,"<p>The provision allows eligible small business to carry back unused 2010 tax year general business tax credits five years and apply them against prior tax liabilities. Other businesses, in general, are allowed to carry back unused credits for one year. Eligible small businesses are defined as those sole proprietorships, partnerships and non-publicly traded corporations with $50million or less in average annual gross receipts for the prior three years.</p>"
Additional exemption for housing provided to individuals displaced by Hurricane Katrina,Commerce and housing,2006-2010,"<p>Taxable income is reduced by $500 for each Hurricane Katrina displaced individual to whom a taxpayer provides housing. The total for each taxpayer is capped at $2,000 and is reduced by any exemptions claimed under the provision for prior years. The exemption is available in 2005 and 2006, although a taxpayer may claim a person only once. No deduction is allowed if the taxpayer receives any rent or other amount (from any source) in connection with the provision of housing.</p>"
Additional first-year depreciation for Gulf Opportunity Zone property,Commerce and housing,2006-2011,"<p>Several provisions provide special allowances for deducting costs relating to businesses in the Gulf Opportunity Zone (GO Zone), an area of the Hurricane Katrina official disaster area (which caused significant damage to the Gulf Coast, including New Orleans, in August of 2005). </p> <p>Taxpayers are allowed to deduct 50% of the cost of investment in depreciable property (machinery, equipment, and buildings), with the remaining property depreciated under normal rules. Property qualifying must commence original use in the GO Zone (used property qualifies if not previously used in the GO Zone) and must be related to an active trade or business in the Zone. Property must be placed in service after August 28, 2005, and before the end of 2007 for equipment and before the end of 2010 for buildings.</p>
"
"Cash accounting, other than agriculture",Commerce and housing,2000-2014,"<p>For tax purposes, the cash method of accounting allows business taxpayers to report income in the year when it is received and take deductions in the year when expenses are paid. By contrast, the accrual method of accounting makes it possible for business taxpayers to recognize income when it is earned  whether or not it has been received  and to claim deductions for expenses in the year when the expenses are incurred. Each accounting method has its advantages. The cash method is simpler to use, while the accrual method often paints a more accurate picture of a business taxpayers income, as it matches income with expenses with greater precision and rigor.</p>"
Completed contract rules,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,"<p>Some taxpayers with construction or manufacturing contracts extending for more than one tax year are allowed to report some or all of the profit on the contracts under special accounting rules rather than the normal rules of tax accounting. Many such taxpayers use the completed contract method.</p>

<p>A taxpayer using the completed contract method of accounting reports income on a long-term contract only when the contract has been completed. All costs properly allocable to the contract are also deducted when the contract is completed and the income reported, but many indirect costs may be deducted in the year paid or incurred. This mismatching of income and expenses allows a deferral of tax payments that creates a tax advantage in this type of reporting.</p>
"
Credit for employer-paid FICA taxes on tips,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,"<p>Tips received by employees providing, serving, or delivering food and beverages are treated as wages under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). This means that employers must pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on those tips, and that employers are required to report any tips received to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In the case of tipped employees, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) allows employers to lower the minimum wage to $2.13 per hour, provided the combination of tips and cash wages equals the applicable federal minimum wage.</p>

<p>Employers of tipped employees may claim a non-refundable tax credit equal to the FICA taxes paid on tips in excess of those treated as cash wages for the purpose of meeting the minimum wage requirements of the FLSA. The credit is available regardless of whether an employee reports tips received.</p>
"
Credit for rehabilitation of historic structures,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,<p>Expenditures on certified structures qualify for a 20 percent tax credit if used to substantially rehabilitate historic structures for use as residential rental or commercial property. The basis (cost for purposes of depreciation) of the building is reduced by the amount of the rehabilitation credit.</p> <p> Certified historic structures are either individually registered in the National Register of Historic Places or are structures certified by the Secretary of the Interior as having historic significance and located in a registered historic district. The State Historic Preservation Office reviews applications and forwards recommendations for designation to the U.S. Department of the Interior. </p>
"Credit for rehabilitation of structures, other than historic structures",Commerce and housing,2006-2014,"<p>Qualified expenditures made to substantially rehabilitate a nonresidential building receive a 10-percent tax credit. Only expenditures on buildings placed in service before 1936 are eligible. Expenditures made during any 24-month period must exceed the greater of $5,000 or the adjusted basis (cost less depreciation taken) of the building. The basis must be reduced by the full amount of the rehabilitation credit.</p>"
Credit for the cost of carrying tax-paid distilled spirits in wholesale inventories,Commerce and housing,2006-2014,<p>This credit applies to domestically bottled distilled spirits purchased directly from the bottler. Distilled spirits that are imported in bulk and then bottled domestically also qualify for the credit. The credit is calculated by multiplying the number of cases of bottled distilled spirits by the average tax-financing cost per case for the most recent calendar year ending before the beginning of the taxable year.</p>
Deduction for premiums for qualified mortgage insurance,Commerce and housing,2007-2014,"<p>Qualified mortgage insurance premiums paid with respect to a qualified residence can be treated as residence interest and is therefore tax deductible. The deduction is phased out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income from $100,000 to $110,000. For the purposes of this deduction, qualified mortgage insurance means mortgage insurance obtained from the Veterans Administration (VA), the Federal Housing Authority (FHA), the Rural Housing Administration (RHA), and private mortgage insurance as defined by the Homeowners Protection Act of 1988.</p>"
Deferral of gain on involuntary conversions resulting from Presidentially-declared disasters,Commerce and housing,2000-2008,"<p>There is no definition available for this tax expenditure in the 2006, 2008, or 2010 Congressional Research Service's <em>Tax Expenditures: Compendium of Background Material on Individual Provisions</em>.</p>"
Deferral of gain on like-kind exchanges,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,"<p>When business or investment property is exchanged for property of a like-kind, no gain or loss is recognized on the exchange and therefore no tax is paid at the time of the exchange on any appreciation. This is in contrast to the general rule that any sale or exchange for money or property is a taxable event.</p>

<p>It is also an exception to the rules allowing tax-free exchanges when the property is similar or related in service or use, the much stricter standard applied in other areas, such as replacing condemned property (section 1033). The latter is not considered a tax expenditure, but the postponed tax on appreciated property exchanged for like-kind property is.</p>
"
Distributions in redemption of stock to pay various taxes imposed at death,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>When a shareholder in a closely held business dies, a partial redemption of stock (selling stock back to the corporation) is treated as a sale or exchange of an asset eligible for long-term capital gain treatment. With step-up in basis there will be no gain or loss on the redemptionthis essentially means that no federal income tax will be due on the redemption. At least 35 percent of the decedents estate must consist of the stock of the corporation. The benefits of this provision are limited in amount to estate taxes and expenses (funeral and administrative) incurred by the estate.</p>"
Exception from net operating loss limitations for corporations in bankruptcy proceedings,Commerce and housing,2000-2011,"<p>In general, net operating losses of corporations may be carried back three years or carried forward fifteen years to offset taxable income in those years. If one corporation acquires another, the tax code has rules to determine whether the acquiring corporation inherits the tax attributes of the acquired corporation, including its net operating loss carryforwards, or whether the tax attributes of the acquired corporation disappear.</p>

<p>If certain conditions are met, subsection 382(l)(5) provides an exception to the general limitation on net operating loss carryforwards for cases in which the acquired corporation was in bankruptcy proceedings at the time of the acquisition. In this case (unless the corporation elects otherwise), the limitation on net operating loss carryforwards does not apply. In some cases, however, certain adjustments are made to the amount of loss carryforwards of the acquired corporation that may be used by the successor corporation.</p>
"
Exclusion of gain or loss on sale or exchange of brownfield property,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>Tax exempt organizations are subject to tax under the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) for activities that are not part of their tax exempt purpose. Gains on the sale of property are not generally taxed unless the property is inventory or stock in trade. Gains from the sale of assets that were debt-financed in part are, however, subject to the UBIT in proportion to the debt. Qualifying brownfield property that is acquired from an unrelated party, subject to remediation, and sold to another unrelated party is exempt from this tax. This provision applies to sales before January 1, 2011.</p>

<p>A qualified contaminated site, or brownfield, is generally defined as any property that 1) is held for use in a trade or business, and 2) on which there has been an actual or threatened release or disposal of certain hazardous substances as certified by the appropriate state environmental agency.</p> <p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the Treasury tax expenditure Exclusion of gain or loss on sale or exchange of certain brownfield sites,"" found in the Natural Resources and Environment Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>
"
Exclusion of interest on State and local qualified private activity bonds for green buildings and sustainable design projects,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>Interest income on state and local bonds used to finance the construction of green building and sustainable design projects, as designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is tax exempt. Green buildings are evaluated based on these criteria: (1) site sustainability; (2) water efficiency; (3) energy use and atmosphere; (4) material and resource use; (5) indoor environmental quality; and (6) innovative design. These bonds are classified as private-activity bonds rather than governmental bonds because a substantial portion of their benefits accrues to individuals or business rather than to the general public. For more discussion of the distinction between governmental bonds and private activity bonds, see the entry under General Purpose Public Assistance: Exclusion of Interest on Public Purpose State and Local Debt.</p>"
Expensing of costs to remove architectural and transportation barriers to the handicapped and elderly,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>Generally, an improvement to a depreciable asset such as a building or motor vehicle is treated for tax purposes as a capital expenditure. This means that the cost of the improvements should be recovered by using the appropriate depreciation method and class life for the asset.</p>

<p>Under section 190, however, a business taxpayer may deduct (or expense) up to $15,000 of the expenses incurred in a single tax year for removing physical barriers to handicapped or elderly (age 65 and older) individuals in qualified facilities or public transportation vehicles that the taxpayer owns or leases. Besides the expensing allowance, eligible small firms may claim a nonrefundable disabled access tax credit under section 44 for expenses they incur to make their operations more accessible to disabled individuals.</p>
"
Expensing of magazine circulation expenditures,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,"<p>In general, current federal tax law allows publishers of newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals to deduct their expenditures to maintain, establish, or increase circulation in the year when they are made.</p>

<p>Deductions of these expenditures as current expenses are permitted, even though expenditures to establish or increase circulation would otherwise be treated as capital expenditures under section 263. The expenditures eligible for this preferential treatment do not include purchases of land and depreciable property, or the expansion of circulation through the purchase of another publisher or its list of subscribers.</p>
"
Five-year carryback period for casualty losses of public utility property attributable to Hurricane Katrina,Commerce and housing,2006-2010,"<p>Several provisions provide special allowances for deducting costs relating to businesses in the Gulf Opportunity Zone (GO Zone), an area of the Hurricane Katrina official disaster area (which caused significant damage to the Gulf Coast, including New Orleans, in August of 2005). </p><p>Several provisions increase loss carryback allowances. Generally firms with losses can carry back losses two years to offset against prior year income, and forward for 20 years. Certain losses attributable to a disaster can be treated as if they occurred in the previous taxable year. For the GO Zone, casualty losses for public utilities, up to the amount of any net operating loss, may be carried back 10 years, and public utility casualty losses in general may be treated as if they occurred in the fifth previous year (effectively a five-year carryback position). </p>
"
Five-year carryback period for losses attributable to various expenses related to Hurricane Katrina,Commerce and housing,2006-2010,"<p>Several provisions provide special allowances for deducting costs relating to businesses in the Gulf Opportunity Zone (GO Zone), an area of the Hurricane Katrina official disaster area (which caused significant damage to the Gulf Coast, including New Orleans, in August of 2005).</p><p>Several provisions increase loss carryback allowances. Generally firms with losses can carry back losses two years to offset against prior year income, and forward for 20 years. Certain losses attributable to a disaster can be treated as if they occurred in the previous taxable year. For all businesses, losses attributable to casualty, moving expense for employees, temporary housing for employees, depreciation and repairs, up to the current net operating loss can be carried back five years.</p>

"
Five-year carryback period for small business,Commerce and housing,2009-2013,"<p>The provision allows eligible small business to carry back unused 2010 tax year general business tax credits five years and apply them against prior tax liabilities. Other businesses, in general, are allowed to carry back unused credits for one year. Eligible small businesses are defined as those sole proprietorships, partnerships and non-publicly traded corporations with $50million or less in average annual gross receipts for the prior three years.</p>"
Inclusion of income arising from business indebtedness discharged by the reacquisition of a debt instrument,Commerce and housing,2009-2014,"<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Public Law 111-5, added to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 108(i), Deferral and ratable inclusion of income arising from business indebtedness discharged by the reacquisition of debt instrument. Section 108(i) allowed financially troubled companies to defer their taxable cancellation of indebtedness income in certain circumstances.</p> <p>Section 108(i) permits a taxpayer to elect to defer income from cancellation of indebtedness recognized by the taxpayer as a result of a repurchase by the taxpayer or a person who bears a relationship to the taxpayer, of a debt instrument that was issued by the taxpayer. Section 108(i) applies only to repurchases of debt that occur after December 31, 2008, and prior to January 1, 2011, and are repurchases for cash. A debt instrument is broadly defined to include any bond, debenture, note, certificate or any other instrument or contractual arrangement constituting indebtedness.</p>
"
Income recognition rule for gain or loss from section 1256 contracts,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>A Section 1256 contract is any regulated futures contract, foreign currency contract, nonequity option, dealer equity option, or dealer securities futures contract that is traded on a qualified board of exchange with a mark-to-market accounting system. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203) clarified that section 1256 does not apply to certain derivatives contracts (e.g., credit default swaps). Under this mark-to-market rule, the gains and losses must be reported on an annual basis, for tax purposes. </p>

<p>The capital gain or loss of applicable contracts are treated as consisting of 40 percent short-term and 60 percent long-term gain or loss. This is true regardless of how long the contract is held. The 60/40 rule does not apply to hedging transactions or limited partnerships. A hedging transaction is a transaction done by a business in its normal operation with the primary purpose of reducing certain risks.</p>
"
Increased standard deduction for real property taxes,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>Taxpayers may claim an itemized deduction for property taxes paid on owner-occupied residences. Taxpayers that do not itemize and pay property taxes may take a deduction in addition to the standard deduction of up to $500 ($250 for single filers). For more on the additional property tax deduction, see the entry titled the Increased Standard Deduction for Real Property Taxes.</p>"
Interest rate and discounting period assumptions for reserves of property and casualty insurance companies,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,"<p>The way in which the present values of future losses for property and casualty insurance companies are calculated may provide those insurers with a tax advantage. A present value is the current equivalent value of a given cash flow and is calculated using interest rates or discount factors and information about the timing of income and losses. Most businesses calculate taxable income by deducting expenses when the business becomes liable for paying them. A significant portion of losses paid by property and casualty insurance companies are paid years after premiums were collected. Funds that an insurer holds between payment of premiums and disbursement of loss claims are known as float and investment earnings on those funds are an important source of revenue in some lines of insurance.</p>

<p>State regulators typically require insurers to maintain minimum levels of loss reserves to ensure solvency, that is, the ability to pay all future claims. On the other hand, if loss reserves are well above levels needed to ensure solvency, an insurer may be able to shift current earnings into future years, thus deferring tax payments. In other words, some form of discounting is appropriate to ensure that premium income, received when a policy is written, is properly matched with associated losses that occur later. If losses in future years are not fully discounted, the insurer may enjoy a tax advantage through the ability to defer loss payments. </p>
"
Last in first out,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>A taxpayer that sells goods must generally maintain inventory records to determine the cost of goods sold. Individuals can account for inventory on an item by item basis, but may also use conventions, which include FIFO (first-in, first-out, assuming the most recent good sold is the earliest one purchased) and LIFO (last-in, first-out, assuming the most recent good sold is the last one purchased). LIFO can only be used if it is also used for financial reporting, although it is not available to securities dealers. </p>

<p>The tax expenditure is based on the notion that basic FIFO is the appropriate method of accounting for costs (unless heterogeneous goods are specifically identified). This view is consistent with the expectation that firms would sell their oldest items first. It is also based on the notion that costs should be allowed only when goods are sold. LIFO allows the appreciation in value to be excluded from income when prices are rising.</p>
"
Lower of cost or market,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>A taxpayer that sells goods must generally maintain inventory records to determine the cost of goods sold. Individuals can account for inventory on an item by item basis, but may also use conventions, which include FIFO (first-in, first-out) and LIFO (last-in, first-out). In connection with FIFO, a taxpayer may choose the LCM method, or lower of cost or market. This method allows the taxpayer a tax deduction for losses on goods that have fallen in value below cost, while in inventory.</p>

<p>The tax expenditure is based on the notion that basic FIFO is the appropriate method of accounting for costs (unless heterogeneous goods are specifically identified). This view is consistent with the expectation that firms would sell their oldest items first. It is also based on the notion that costs should be allowed only when goods are sold. LCM allows recognition of losses when inventory declines in value (but there is no recognition of gain for rise in value).</p>
"
Specific identification for homogeneous products,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>A taxpayer that sells goods must generally maintain inventory records to determine the cost of goods sold. Individuals can account for inventory on an item by item basis, but may also use conventions, which include FIFO (first-in, first-out) and LIFO (last-in, first-out). In connection with FIFO, a taxpayer may choose the LCM method, or lower of cost or market. This method allows the taxpayer a tax deduction for losses on goods that have fallen in value below cost, while in inventory.</p>

This view is consistent with the expectation that firms would sell their oldest items first. It is also based on the notion that costs should be allowed only when goods are sold. Allowing specific identification permits firms to select higher cost items and minimize taxable income.</p>

Leasehold improvement property,Commerce and housing,2008-2013,"<p>Taxpayers are allowed to deduct the costs of acquiring depreciable assets (assets that wear out or become obsolete over a period of years) as depreciation deductions. The tax code currently allows new buildings other than rental housing to be written off over 39 years, using a straight line method where equal amounts are deducted in each period. There is also a prescribed 40 year write-off period for these buildings under the alternative minimum tax (also based on a straight-line method).</p>

<p>Improvements required for a new leasehold for a non-residential structure, for certain restaurant improvements and for certain retail improvements made at least three years after original construction may be depreciated over 15 years. This provision applies through 2011.</p>

Net alternative minimum tax attributable to net operating loss limitation,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>The provision allows eligible taxpayers to elect to carry back an applicable net operating loss (NOL) for a period of 3, 4, or 5 years, or a loss from operations for 4 or 5 years, to offset taxable income in those preceding taxable years. Eligible taxpayers are all taxpayers except for those who receive federal assistance from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. If the taxpayer makes this election, an alternative minimum tax net operating loss from the election year can be carried back without being subject to limit. Otherwise, alternative minimum tax net operating losses are limited to offset no more than 90 percent of the alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) for the carryback year.</p>"
Ordinary gain or loss treatment for sale or exchange of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock by certain financial institutions,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>Capital gains or losses from the sale or exchange of preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are treated as ordinary income or loss by applicable financial institutions, which include banks, mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, and savings and loan associations, among others. For sales or exchanges between January 1, 2008 and September 6, 2008, the taxpayer must have been an applicable financial institution at the time of the sale. For sales after September 6, 2008, the taxpayer had to be an applicable financial institution at all times between September 6, 2008 and the time of the sale or exchange, and the preferred stock had to be held by the institution on September 6, 2008.</p>"
Partial expensing of Gulf Opportunity Zone clean-up costs,Commerce and housing,2006-2010,"<p>Several provisions provide special allowances for deducting costs relating to businesses in the Gulf Opportunity Zone (GO Zone), an area of the Hurricane Katrina official disaster area (which caused significant damage to the Gulf Coast, including New Orleans, in August of 2005). </p>
<p>The cost of demolition of buildings and the removal of some debris is normally added to the basis of land which is not depreciable; 50% of the costs of this nature incurred in the GO Zone after August 28, 2005 and through 2007 may be deducted. </p>

Proration for property and casualty insurance companies,Commerce and housing,2008-2014,"<p>A property and casualty insurance companys taxable income during a tax year is its underwriting income (i.e., premiums minus incurred losses and expenses) plus investment income and certain other income items minus allowable deductions. Additions to loss reserves, held to pay future claims, can also be deducted from taxable income under certain conditions. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) imposed the 15 percent pro-ration provision, as Congress held that using tax-exempt investments to finance additions to loss reserves was inappropriate. Therefore, the allowable deduction for additions to loss reserves was reduced to 15 percent of (I) the insurers tax-exempt interest, (ii) the deductible portion of dividends received (with special rules for dividends from affiliates), and (iii) the increase for the taxable year in the cash value of life insurance, endowment or annuity contracts.</p>"

Special deduction for Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies,Commerce and housing,2000-2014,"<p>Blue Cross and Blue Shield and a number of smaller health insurance providers that existed on August 16, 1986, and other nonprofit health insurers that meet certain community-service and medical loss ratio standards receive special tax treatment. </p>

<p>The Blue Cross and Blue Shield special deduction has two main features. First, eligible health insurers are treated in the tax law as stock property and casualty insurance companies. Eligible organizations, however, can fully deduct unearned premiums, unlike other property and casualty insurance companies. Second, eligible companies may take a special deduction of 25 percent of the years health-related claims and expenses minus its accumulated surplus at the beginning of the year (if such claims and expenses exceed the accumulated surplus).

Eliminate requirement that financial institutions allocate interest expense attributable to tax-exempt interest,Community and regional development,2009-2014,"<p>In the 111th Congress, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5, ARRA) created new rules for banks (and other financial institutions) that invest in tax-exempt bonds. Banks deduct interest expense, the interest they pay to depositors, as a cost of doing business, thereby reducing their tax liability. They have to reduce this interest expense, however, if the bank has invested in tax-exempt bonds. Generally, banks and financial institutions are required to reduce their interest rate expense deduction by the same ratio as tax-exempt bonds have to all assets in their portfolio. The rule is in place to keep banks from benefitting from two tax preferences for the same investment.</p>

<p>Tax-exempt bond investments by individuals and non-financial institutions that comprise less than 2 percent of their investment portfolio, however, are not required to reduce their interest expense deduction. Also, investment by banks in qualified tax-exempt bonds receive more favorable tax treatment. Under this provision, the interest expense deduction is reduced by 20 percent of the interest expense allocable to these bonds. This confers a more favorable treatment on the qualified tax-exempt bonds and is often identified as the two percent rule.</p>

Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code provides an express exception to this rule when certain nontaxable benefits are chosen under a cafeteria plan.

"Exclusion of medical care and TRICARE medical insurance for military dependents, retirees, and retiree dependents not enrolled in Medicare",Health,2000-2014,"<p>Active-duty military personnel are provided with a variety of benefits (or cash payments in lieu of such benefits) that are not subject to taxation. Among such benefits are medical and dental care. Dependents of active-duty personnel, retired military personnel and their dependents, veterans, survivors of deceased members, and reservists who have served on active duty since September 11, 2001 and join the Selected Reserve are also eligible for these health benefits and thus can take advantage of the tax exclusion.</p>

Apportionment of research and development expenses for determination of foreign tax credits,International affairs,2008-2014,"<p>The federal government taxes firms incorporated in the United States on their worldwide income but taxes foreign-based firms on their U.S. income only. When a U.S. firm earns foreign income through a foreign subsidiary, U.S. taxes apply to that income only when it is repatriated to the U.S. parent firm in the form of dividends, royalties, or other income; the foreign income is exempt from U.S. taxation as long as it remains in the control of the foreign subsidiary.</p>

<p>When the foreign-source income is repatriated, the U.S. parent corporation can claim a credit against its U.S. tax liability for any foreign taxes the subsidiary has paid on that income. The credit cannot exceed the U.S. tax due on the foreign-source income. It is intended to avoid double taxation of repatriated foreign income. Excess credits incurred in tax years beginning after October 22, 2004 may be carried back one year and then carried forward up to 10 years. </p>

<p>Federal tax law requires U.S. multinational corporations to allocate deductible expenses that could be related to both foreign and domestic income, such as interest payments and spending on research and development (R&D), between U.S. and foreign earnings.</p> 

<p>The allocation of research expenses between foreign-source and U.S.- source income is governed by a set of regulations (Reg. 1.861-17) issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 1995. They proceed on the assumption that research expenses ordinarily deducted under section 174 are 41 related to all income associated with broad product categories and can be allocated to all sources of that income, such as sales, royalties, or dividends.</p>

Interest expense allocation,International affairs,2008-2014,"<p>Current law applies the fungibility principle to interest allocation in a manner sometimes referred to as waters edge allocation. Under this 68 system, foreign subsidiaries are not explicitly included in the allocation. This has two implications for the allocation formula. First, only a domestic parents equity stake in its foreign subsidiary is counted as an asset  excluding the foreign subsidiarys assets financed by debt. The parents assets, in contrast, are all included in the calculationwhether financed by equity or debt. Secondly, the subsidiarys interest expense is automatically allocated to foreign sources. This occurs since the subsidiarys interest expense reduces dividend payments to the parent, which are all allocated to foreign source income. </p>

<p>Under current law, beginning in 2021, the U.S. will allocate interest expense using a worldwide allocation regime. Under a worldwide allocation, the borrowing of foreign subsidiaries would be taken into account.</p>

Special rules for interest-charge domestic international sales corporations,International affairs,2008-2014,"<p>An Interest Charge Domestic Sales Corporations (IC-DISC) is a domestic corporation, usually formed by parent shareholders (e.g., corporations, individuals, and trusts) to be a tax-exempt subsidiary, which exports U.S. products. The parent company pays the IC-DISC a tax deductible commission attributable to qualified export sales. Because the ICDISC pays no tax, distributions (actual or deemed) to IC-DISC shareholders are taxed only once, often at the lower individual dividend and capital gains tax rates. As a result, the after tax return to shareholders is enhanced.</p>

<p>IC-DISC shareholders may defer up to $10 million that is attributable to qualified export sales. An interest charge is imposed on shareholders, however, based on the distribution that would have occurred had deferral not been elected. The $10 million deferral restriction was intended to limit the benefit of IC-DISC activity to smaller businesses.</p>

Taxation of real property gains of foreign persons*,International affairs,2008-2013,"<p>The Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 The Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA) explicitly classifies the disposition of a U.S. real property interest as effectively connected with U.S. trade or business. Therefore, the net capital gain or loss from the disposition of U.S. real property by a foreigner is subject to U.S. personal and/or corporate income taxes. U.S. real property interests include parcels of real property as well as certain shares in U.S. real property holding corporations. </p>

Tonnage tax,International affairs,2008-2014,"<p>All domestic corporations in the United States are subject to tax on their worldwide income. To limit the extent of double taxation, U.S. firms with foreign-source income are allowed a credit against foreign paid taxes. The U.S. also only taxes foreign corporate income sufficiently connected to trade or business in the U.S.. Such foreign corporate income is subject to the same tax as domestic corporate income. </p>

<p>Corporations involved in shipping trade and business operations may, as an alternative to the conventional corporate income tax, elect to pay the tonnage tax.

Exclusion of certain subsidies to employers who maintain prescription drug plans for Medicare enrollees,Medicare,2004-2014,"<p>The Medicare program has four components: Parts A , B, C, and D. Part D offers a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit that began on January 1, 2006. Every individual enrolled in Medicare Parts A or B, or who receives Medicare benefits through a private health plan under Part C, is eligible to enroll in a qualified prescription drug plan.</p>
<p>Federal subsidies are available to encourage widespread participation by low-income Medicare beneficiaries, and to prevent large numbers of public and private employers and unions that offer prescription drug benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees from dropping or sharply cutting this coverage. Public and private employers and unions electing the subsidy payments must agree to subject their drug benefits for retirees to continuing federal scrutiny.</p>
<p>In 2010 and 2011, the subsidy payments from this program are equal to 28 percent of a qualified retirees allowable gross prescription drug costs between $310 and $6,300. This means that the maximum subsidy for a qualified retiree in each year is $1764. Employers who choose to receive subsidy payments are allowed to exclude them from their taxable income under both the regular income tax and the alternative minimum tax. In addition, an employer may disregard any subsidy it receives in calculating its deduction for health benefits for current employees and retirees. For tax years starting on or after January 1, 2013, employers will be required to reduce that deduction by the amount of any subsidy received, subjecting the subsidy to taxation.</p>

Hospital insurance (Part A),Medicare,2000-2014,"<p>The Medicare program has four main components: Parts A, B, C, and D. Part A offers hospital insurance (HI). It covers most of the cost of in-patient hospital care and as much as 100 days a year of skilled nursing facility care, home health care, and hospice care for individuals who are age 65 and over or disabled.</p>

<p>Medicare Part A is financed primarily by a payroll tax levied on the earnings of current workers. The tax rate is 2.90 percent, and there is no ceiling on the earnings subject to the tax. Self-employed individuals pay the full rate, while employees and employers each pay 1.45 percent. The employers share of the payroll tax is excluded from an employees taxable income. Moreover, the expected lifetime value of Part A benefits under current law exceeds the amount of payroll tax contributions by current beneficiaries. These excess benefits are excluded from the taxable income of Medicare Part A beneficiaries.</p>
"
Prescription drug insurance (Part D),Medicare,2004-2014,"<p>The Medicare program has four main components: Parts A, B, C, and D. Part D provides an outpatient prescription drug benefit, which went into effect on January 1, 2006. The benefit is offered through stand-alone private prescription drug plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, such as health maintenance organizations, that provide all Medicare benefits, including coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike other Medicare services, Medicare beneficiaries can obtain the drug benefit only by enrolling in one of those plans, which are open to anyone entitled to Medicare Part A and/or enrolled in Medicare Part B.</p>

<p>Part D plans offer either a defined standard benefit or an alternative benefit that is actuarially equivalent. They may also offer enhanced benefits. Funding for Part D comes from a combination of enrollee premiums, state contributions (through the so-called clawback provision), and general federal revenues. In keeping with the tax treatment of benefits received by beneficiaries under Parts A and B of Medicare, transfers from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury and state governments to pay for the cost of the drug benefit not covered by premiums are excluded from the taxable income of enrollees.</p>
"
Supplementary medical insurance (Part B),Medicare,2000-2014,"<p>The Medicare program has four main components: Parts A, B, C and D. Part B of Medicare provides supplementary medical insurance (SMI).

<p>Unlike Part A of Medicare, participation in SMI is voluntary. Enrollees must pay a minimum monthly premium that varies over time. The program generally pays for 80 percent of Medicare's fee schedule or other approved amounts after a beneficiary satisfies an annual deductible, which is $155 in 2010. Premiums are set to cover 25 percent of the program's estimated costs for most recipients; the remaining 75 percent is funded out of general revenues.
