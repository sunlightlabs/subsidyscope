Bio-Diesel and small agri-biodiesel producer tax credits,Agriculture,2004-2006,"<p>An income tax credit of $0.50, similar to Ethanol benefits, is available for each gallon of biodiesel used or sold. Biodiesel derived fromvirgin sources (agri-biodiesel) receives an increased credit of $1.00 per gallon. The Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2005 extends the income tax credit, excise tax credit, and payment provisions through December 31, 2008 and adds a credit for small agri-biodiesel producers. The conference agreement also creates a similar income tax credit, excise tax credit and payment system for renewable diesel, however there is no credit for small producers of renewable diesel. Renewable diesel means diesel fuel derived form biomass using thermal depolymerization process.</p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the tax expenditure ""Bio-Diesel and small agri-biodiesel producer tax credits,"" found in the Energy Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Capital gains treatment of certain income,Agriculture,2000-2016,"<p>For individuals in 2010, tax rates on regular income vary from 10 percent to 35 percent, depending on the taxpayer's income. The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, current law allows capital gains to be taxed at a preferentially low rate that is no higher than 15 percent. Certain agricultural income, such as unharvested crops, qualify for taxation as capital gains rather than ordinary income, and so benefit from the preferentially low 15 percent maximum tax rate on capital gains.</p>"
Deferral of gain on sale of farm refiners,Agriculture,2000-2016,"<p> The baseline tax system generally subjects capital gains to taxes the year that they are realized. However, the Tax Code allows a taxpayer who sells stock in a farm refiner to a farmers' cooperative to defer recognition of the gain if the proceeds are re-invested in a qualified replacement property. </p>"
Expensing of certain multiperiod production costs,Agriculture,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system requires the taxpayer to capitalize costs associated with an investment over time. However, the production of livestock and crops with a production period greater than two years (e.g., establishing orchards or constructing barns) is exempt from the uniform cost capitalization rules, thereby accelerating cost recovery. </p>"
Expensing of reforestation expenditures,Agriculture,2010-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system requires the taxpayer to capitalize costs associated with an investment over time. In contrast, the Tax Code provides for the expensing of the first $10,000 in reforestation expenditures with 7-year amortization of the remaining expenses. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the JCT tax expenditure ""Amortization and expensing of reforestation expenditures,"" found in the Natural Resources and Environment Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Cancellation of indebtedness,Commerce and housing,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, under current law individuals are not required to report the cancellation of certain indebtedness as current income. If the canceled debt is not reported as current income, however, the basis of the underlying property must be reduced by the amount canceled. </p>"
"Exception from passive loss rules for $25,000 of rental loss",Commerce and housing,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system accepts current law's general rule limiting taxpayers' ability to deduct losses from passive activities against nonpassive income (e.g., wages, interest, and dividends). Passive activities generally are defined as those in which the taxpayer does not materially participate and there are numerous additional considerations brought to bear on the determination of which activities are passive for a given taxpayer. Losses are limited in an attempt to limit tax sheltering activities. Passive losses that are unused may be carried forward and applied against future passive income. In contrast to the general restrictions on passive losses, the Tax Code exempts owners of rental real estate activities from ""passive income'' limitations. The exemption is limited to $25,000 in losses and phases out for taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $150,000. </p>"
Excess bad debt reserves of financial institutions,Commerce and housing,2000-2007,"Small (less than $500 million in assets) commercial banks, mutual savings banks, and savings and loan associations may deduct additions to bad debt reserves in excess of actually experienced losses."
Exclusion of interest spread of financial institutions,Commerce and housing,2005-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Consumers and nonprofit organizations pay for some deposit-linked services, such as check cashing, by accepting a below-market interest rate on their demand deposits. If they received a market rate of interest on those deposits and paid explicit fees for the associated services, they would pay taxes on the full market rate and (unlike businesses) could not deduct the fees. The Government thus foregoes tax on the difference between the risk-free market interest rate and below-market interest rates on demand deposits, which under competitive conditions should equal the value added of deposit services. </p>"
Exclusion of net imputed rental income,Commerce and housing,2004-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, the taxable income of a taxpayer who is an owner-occupant would include the implicit value of gross rental income on housing services earned on the investment in owner-occupied housing and would allow a deduction for expenses, such as interest, depreciation, property taxes, and other costs, associated with earning such rental income.  In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from taxable income for the implicit gross rental income on housing services, while in certain circumstances allows a deduction for some costs associated with such income, such as for mortgage interest and property taxes. </p>"
Tax exemption of certain insurance companies owned by tax-exempt organizations,Commerce and housing,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, corporations pay taxes on their profits under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Generally the income generated by life and property and casualty insurance companies is subject to tax, albeit by special rules. Insurance operations conducted by such exempt organizations as fraternal societies, voluntary employee benefit associations, and others, however, are exempt from tax. </p>"
Credit to holders of Gulf Tax Credit Bonds,Community and regional development,2005-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Instead, under current law taxpayers that own Gulf and Midwest Tax Credit bonds receive a non-refundable tax credit rather than interest. The credit is included in gross income. </p>"
Deferral of capital gains with respect of dispositions of transmission property,Community and regional development,2004-2004,"<p>This provision, introduced by the AJCA, provides for the deferral of gains from sales or dispositions to implement Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or State electric restructuring policy.</p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the Treasury tax expenditure ""Deferral of gain from dispositions of transmission property to implement FERC restructuring policy,"" found in the Energy Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Exemption of certain mutuals' and cooperatives' income,Community and regional development,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, corporations pay taxes on their profits under the regular tax rate schedule. In contrast, the Tax Code provides for the incomes of mutual and cooperative telephone and electric companies to be exempt from tax if at least 85 percent of their revenues are derived from patron service charges. </p>"
American Opportunity Tax Credit,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2009-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In contrast, the Tax Code was modified in 2009 to provide a tax credit in 2009 and 2010 of up to $2,500 per eligible student for qualified tuition and related expenses paid for each of the first four years of the student's post-secondary education. The credit is phased out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income between $80,000 and $90,000 ($160,000 and $180,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return). </p>"
Assistance for adopted foster children,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2000-2016,"<p> Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. Taxpayers who adopt eligible children from the public foster care system can receive monthly payments for the children's significant and varied needs and a reimbursement of up to $2,000 for nonrecurring adoption expenses. These payments are excluded from gross income under current law. </p>"
Employee retention credit for employers in certain federal disaster areas,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2005-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In contrast, the Tax Code provides tax credits against the wages paid to eligible employees in areas affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and Ike. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the JCT tax expenditure ""Disaster Relief: Gulf Opportunity Zone,"" found in the Community and Regional Development Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Exclusion for benefits provided to volunteer EMS and firefighters,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2007-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, would be included in taxable income. Dedicated payments and in-kind benefits represent accretions to wealth that do not differ materially from cash wages. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from taxable income of certain rebates or reductions of state and local income and property taxes provided by states or localities if the taxpayer is a member of a volunteer emergency response organization. The Tax Code also allows an exclusion from taxable income of certain payments such as reimbursements for expenses or equipment allowances of up to $360 per year provided by states or localities on account of performance of services as a member of a volunteer emergency response organization. </p>"
Making work pay tax credit ,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2009-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities. In contrast, the Tax Code was modified in 2009 to provide for a tax credit in 2009 and 2010 of the lesser of 6.2 percent of an individual's earned income or $400 ($800 for joint filers). It is phased out at a rate of 2 percent of modified AGI above $75,000 ($150,000 for joint filers). </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the JCT tax expenditure ""Making work pay credit,"" found in the Income Security Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Temporary income exclusion for employer provided lodging in Midwestern disaster area,"Education, training, employment, and social services",2008-2009," Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, under current law employer-provided meals and lodging in disaster areas are excluded from an employee's gross income even though the employer's costs for these items are a deductible business expense. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the JCT tax expenditure ""Disaster Relief: Midwest Disaster Relief,"" found in the Community and Regional Development Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Alternative Fuel and Fuel Mixture tax credit,Energy,2005-2005,"<p>This provision was introduced in the Safe, Accountable,
Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act of
2005. A tax credit is available against the excise tax
imposed on the retail sale or use of alternative fuels
or mixture of alternative fuel and other taxable fuel.
The credit is 50 cents per gallon of alternative fuel.</p>"
Capital gains treatment of royalties on coal,Energy,2000-2016,"<p> For individuals in 2010, tax rates on regular income vary from 10 percent to 35 percent, depending on the taxpayer's income. The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, current law allows capital gains to be taxed at a preferentially low rate that is no higher than 15 percent. Certain sales of coal under royalty contracts qualify for taxation as capital gains rather than ordinary income, and so benefit from the preferentially low 15 percent maximum tax rate on capital gains. </p>"
Credit for business installation of qualified fuel cells and stationary microturbine power plants,Energy,2005-2007,"<p>A 30 percent business energy credit for purchase
of qualified fuel cell power plants for businesses
(up to $500 for each 0.5 kilowatt of capacity) and a
10 percent credit for purchase of qualifying stationary
microturbine power plants (up to a maximum of $200
for each kilowatt of capacity) are allowed. The credit
applies to property placed in service prior to January
1, 2009.</p>"
Credit for production from advanced nuclear power facilities,Energy,2005-2005,"<p>This provision was introduced by
the Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2005. A taxpayer producing
electricity at a qualifying advanced nuclear
power facility may claim a credit equal to 1.8 cents
per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced for the eightyear
period starting when the facility is placed in service,
limited no more than $125 million in tax credits
per 1,000 megawatts of allocated capacity in any one
year.</p>"
Exception from passive loss limitation for working interests in oil and gas properties,Energy,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system accepts current law's general rule limiting taxpayers' ability to deduct losses from passive activities against nonpassive income (e.g., wages, interest, and dividends). Passive activities generally are defined as those in which the taxpayer does not materially participate and there are numerous additional considerations brought to bear on the determination of which activities are passive for a given taxpayer. Losses are limited in an attempt to limit tax sheltering activities. Passive losses that are unused may be carried forward and applied against future passive income. In contrast to the general restrictions on passive losses, the Tax Code exempts owners of working interests in oil and gas properties from ""passive income'' limitations, such that the working interest-holder who manages the development of wells and incurs all operating costs on behalf of himself and all other owners may aggregate negative taxable income (i.e., losses) from such interests with his other income. Thus, these taxpayers are able to fully deduct passive losses against nonpassive income, in contradiction to the general prohibition against such deductions. </p>"
Partial expensing for advanced mine safety equipment,Energy,2006-2008,"<p>The baseline tax system generally allows depreciation
deductions based on estimates of the decline in
the value of an asset as it ages. It would not allow faster
write-offs for a particular class of assets or industries. In
contrast, the Tax Code allows qualified mine safety equipment
placed in service before 2009 to be expensed (deducted
immediately) rather than depreciated over time.</p>"
Build America Bonds ,General purpose fiscal assistance,2009-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific group. In contrast, the Tax Code in 2009 allowed State and local governments to issue taxable bonds and receive a direct payment from Treasury equal to 35 percent of interest expenses. Alternatively, State and local governments may issue taxable bonds and the private lenders receive the 35 percent credit which is included in taxable income. </p>"
Distributions from retirement plans for premiums for health and long-term care insurance,Health,2006-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated and deferred payments, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, the Tax Code provides for tax-free distributions of up to $3,000 from governmental retirement plans for premiums for health and long term care premiums of public safety officers. </p>"
Special Blue Cross/Blue Shield deduction,Health,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all profits under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance providers in existence on August 16, 1986, and certain other nonprofit health insurers, are provided exceptions from otherwise applicable insurance company income tax accounting rules that substantially reduce their tax liabilities, provided that their percentage of total premium revenue expended on reimbursement for clinical services provided to enrollees is not less than 85 percent for the taxable year. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the JCT tax expenditure ""Special deduction for Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies,"" found in the Commerce and Housing Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Additional exemption for housing Hurricane Katrina displaced individuals,Income security,2005-2009,"<p>The tax rate schedule, including personal exemptions and the standard deduction, are part of the baseline tax system.

Exclusion of military disability pensions,Income security,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income.

Exclusion of railroad retirement system benefits,Income security,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated and deferred payments, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, railroad retirement benefits are not generally subject to the income tax unless the recipient's gross income reaches a certain threshold under current law. The threshold is discussed more fully under the Social Security function. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the tax expenditure ""Social Security benefits for retired workers,"" found in the Social Security Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Income of trusts to finance supplementary unemployment benefits,Income security,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. Employers may establish trusts to pay supplemental unemployment benefits to employees separated from employment. Investment income earned by such trusts is exempt from taxation. </p>"
Special ESOP rules,Income security,2000-2016,"<p>Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) are a special type of tax-exempt employee benefit plan. Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, employer-paid contributions (the value of stock issued to the ESOP) are deductible by the employer as part of employee compensation costs. They are not included in the employees' gross income for tax purposes, however, until they are paid out as benefits. In addition, the following special income tax provisions for ESOPs are intended to increase ownership of corporations by their employees: (1) annual employer contributions are subject to less restrictive limitations than other qualified retirement plans; (2) ESOPs may borrow to purchase employer stock, guaranteed by their agreement with the employer that the debt will be serviced by his payment (deductible by him) of a portion of wages (excludable by the employees) to service the loan; (3) employees who sell appreciated company stock to the ESOP may defer any taxes due until they withdraw benefits; and (4) dividends paid to ESOP-held stock are deductible by the employer. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the JCT tax expenditure ""Special tax provisions for employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs),"" found in the Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Deduction for endangered species recovery expenditures,Natural resources and environment,2008-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, under current law farmers can deduct up to 25 percent of their gross income for expenses incurred as a result of site and habitat improvement activities that will benefit endangered species on their farm land, in accordance with site specific management actions included in species recovery plans approved pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973. </p>"
Exclusion of gain or loss on sale or exchange of certain brownfield sites,Natural resources and environment,2004-2016,"<p>In general, a tax-exempt organization must pay taxes on income from activities unrelated to its nonprofit status.

Expensing of capital costs with respect to complying with EPA sulfur regulations,Natural resources and environment,2004-2009,"<p>The baseline tax system allows the taxpayer to deduct the decline in the economic value of an investment over time. However, the Tax Code allows small refiners to deduct 75 percent of qualified capital costs incurred during the taxable year, thereby accelerating cost recovery relative to economic depreciation. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the JCT tax expenditure ""Tax credit and deduction for small refiners with capital costs associated with EPA sulfur regulation compliance,"" found in the Energy Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Industrial CO2 capture and sequestration tax credit,Natural resources and environment,2008-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In contrast, the Tax Code allows a credit of $20 per metric ton for qualified carbon dioxide captured at a qualified facility and disposed of in secure geological storage. In addition, the provision allows a credit of $10 per metric ton of qualified carbon dioxide that is captured at a qualified facility and as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project. </p>"
Investment credit and seven-year amortization for reforestation expenditures,Natural resources and environment,2000-2000,"<p>A 10-percent investment tax credit is allowed for up to $10,000 invested annually to clear land and plant trees for the production of timber. Up to $10,000 in forestation investment may also be amortized over a seven-year period rather than capitalized and deducted when the trees are sold or harvested. The amount of forestation investment that may be amortized is not reduced by any of the allowable investment credit. </p>"
Tax incentives for preservation of historic structures,Natural resources and environment,2000-2016,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. However, expenditures to preserve and restore certified historic structures qualify for an investment tax credit of 20 percent under current law for certified rehabilitation activities. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the JCT tax expenditure ""Credit for rehabilitation of historic structures,"" found in the Commerce and Housing Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
Social Security benefits for disabled workers,Social Security,2000-2016,"<p> Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. Under current law, however, benefit payments from the Social Security Trust Fund for disability are fully or partially excluded from a beneficiary's gross incomes. (See provision number 163, Social Security benefits for retired workers.) </p>"
"Social Security benefits for spouses, dependents and survivors",Social Security,2000-2016,"<p>Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages.

Tax Credit for Certain Government Retirees,Social Security,2009-2009,"<p>The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific group. In contrast, the Tax Code was modified in 2009 to provide a tax credit of $250 for certain government retirees who do not receive social security benefits. This credit is provided so as to equalize the treatment with social security beneficiaries who received $250 in stimulus payments in 2009. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the Treasury tax expenditure ""$250 credit against income taxes owed for 2009,"" found in the Income Security Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>"
