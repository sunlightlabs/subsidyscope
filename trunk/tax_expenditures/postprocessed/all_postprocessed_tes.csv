Passive activities generally are defined as those in which the taxpayer does not materially participate and there are numerous additional considerations brought to bear on the determination of which activities are passive for a given taxpayer. Losses are limited in an attempt to limit tax sheltering activities. Passive losses that are unused may be carried forward and applied against future passive income. In contrast to the general restrictions on passive losses, the Tax Code exempts owners of working interests in oil and gas properties from ""passive income'' limitations, such that the working interest-holder who manages the development of wells and incurs all operating costs on behalf of himself and all other owners may aggregate negative taxable income (i.e., losses) from such interests with his other income. Thus, these taxpayers are able to fully deduct passive losses against nonpassive income, in contradiction to the general prohibition against such deductions. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

Cost depletion is similar in concept to depreciation, in that the costs of developing or acquiring the asset are capitalized and then gradually reduced over an estimate of the asset's productive life, as is appropriate for measuring net income. In contrast, the Tax Code generally allows independent fuel and mineral producers and royalty owners to take percentage depletion deductions rather than cost depletion on limited quantities of output. Under percentage depletion, taxpayers deduct a percentage of gross income from mineral production. In certain cases the deduction is limited to a fraction of the asset's net income. Over the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost of the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion offers more generous tax treatment than would cost depletion, which would limit deductions to an investment's cost. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

This insures that the net income from the well is measured appropriately each year. In contrast to this treatment, current law allows intangible drilling costs for successful investments in domestic oil and gas wells (such as wages, the cost of using machinery for grading and drilling, and the cost of unsalvageable materials used in constructing wells) to be deducted immediately, i.e., expensed. Because it allows recovery of costs sooner, expensing is more generous for the taxpayer than would be amortization. Integrated oil companies may deduct only 70 percent of such costs and must amortize the remaining 30 percent over five years. The same rule applies to the exploration and development costs of surface stripping and the construction of shafts and tunnels for other fuel minerals. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

However, such expenses would not be deductible when the income or the return on an investment is not taxed. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from a taxpayer's taxable income for the value of owner-occupied housing services but allows the owner-occupant to deduct mortgage interest paid on his or her primary and secondary residences as an itemized non-business deduction. In general, the mortgage interest deduction is limited to interest on debt no greater than the owner's basis in the residence, and is also limited to interest on debt of no more than $1 million. Interest on up to $100,000 of other debt secured by a lien on a principal or second residence is also deductible, irrespective of the purpose of borrowing, provided the total debt does not exceed the fair market value of the residence. As an alternative to the deduction, holders of qualified Mortgage Credit Certificates issued by State or Local governmental units or agencies may claim a tax credit of up to 20 percent of the interest expense. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

A present value is the current equivalent value of a given cash flow and is calculated using interest rates or discount factors and information about the timing of income and losses. Most businesses calculate taxable income by deducting expenses when the business becomes liable for paying them. A significant portion of losses paid by property and casualty insurance companies are paid years after premiums were collected. Funds that an insurer holds between payment of premiums and disbursement of loss claims are known as ""float"" and investment earnings on those funds are an important source of revenue in some lines of insurance.</p><p>State regulators typically require insurers to maintain minimum levels of loss reserves to ensure solvency. On the other hand, if loss reserves are well above levels needed to ensure solvency, an insurer may be able to shift current earnings into future years, thus deferring tax payments. In other words, some form of discounting is appropriate to ensure that premium income, received when a policy is written, is properly matched with associated losses that occur later. If losses in future years are not fully discounted, the insurer may enjoy a tax advantage through the ability to defer loss payments.</p>

In contrast, under current law individual taxpayers can take advantage of traditional and Roth IRAs to defer or otherwise reduce the tax on the return to their retirement savings. The IRA contribution limit is $5,000 in 2010 (indexed); taxpayers age 50 or over are allowed to make additional ""catch-up'' contributions of $1,000. Contributions to a traditional IRA are generally deductible but the deduction is phased out for workers with incomes above certain levels who, or whose spouses, are active participants in an employer-provided retirement plan. Contributions and account earnings are includible in income when withdrawn from traditional IRAs. Individuals who make nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA can still benefit from deferral of tax on earnings. Roth IRA contributions are not deductible, but earnings and withdrawals are exempt from taxation under certain conditions. Income limits also apply to Roth IRA contributions; however, taxpayers at any income level may roll account balances from traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs, after paying income tax on any deduction and accrued income. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

"#","Phase out of the personal exemption for regular income tax, and disallowance of the personal exemption and the standard deduction for the alternative minimum tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Prior to 2010, the deduction for personal and dependency exemptions was phased out for higher income taxpayers. The total exemption amount was reduced by 2 percent for each $2,500 ($1,250 for married persons filing separately) of adjusted gross income (AGI) above the threshold amount. The personal exemption phase-out was initially reduced beginning in 2006 and is fully eliminated for tax years beginning after 2010 (the elimination, however, expires at the end of 2012).</p>

<p>The alternative minimum tax (AMT) standard deduction (or exemption amount) is phased out for taxpayers with high AMT income (AMTI). Under the phase-out, these exemption amounts are reduced by $0.25 for every $1 of AMTI over $150,000 for joint filers and $112,500 for single filers. Thus, taxpayers filing jointly with AMTI at or over $433,800 ($299,300 for single filers) in 2009 did not have an AMT standard deduction.</p>

Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, employer-paid contributions (the value of stock issued to the ESOP) are deductible by the employer as part of employee compensation costs. They are not included in the employees' gross income for tax purposes, however, until they are paid out as benefits. In addition, the following special income tax provisions for ESOPs are intended to increase ownership of corporations by their employees: (1) annual employer contributions are subject to less restrictive limitations than other qualified retirement plans; (2) ESOPs may borrow to purchase employer stock, guaranteed by their agreement with the employer that the debt will be serviced by his payment (deductible by him) of a portion of wages (excludable by the employees) to service the loan; (3) employees who sell appreciated company stock to the ESOP may defer any taxes due until they withdraw benefits; and (4) dividends paid to ESOP-held stock are deductible by the employer. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the JCT tax expenditure ""Special tax provisions for employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs),"" found in the Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services Budget Function and available <a href=""/tax_expenditures/db/group/349/?estimate=3&year=2001"">here</a>.</p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

Prior to January 1, 2009, taxpayers could also elect an alternative incremental credit regime. Under the alternative incremental credit regime the taxpayer was assigned a three-tiered fixed base percentage that is lower than the fixed-base percentage that would otherwise apply, and the credit rate was reduced.

The baseline assumed for the normal tax method is that all R&E expenditures are successful and have an expected life of five years. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

The parent company pays the IC-DISC a tax deductible commission attributable to qualified export sales.

<p>FIRPTA also requires income tax withholding for the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by a foreign person. The withholding is a deposit towards expected taxes arising from the sale of U.S. real property. A number of exemptions from the withholding requirement exist.

"#","Eliminate requirement that financial institutions allocate interest expense attributable to tax-exempt interest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>In the 111th Congress, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5, ARRA) created new rules for banks (and other financial institutions) that invest in tax-exempt bonds. Banks deduct interest expense, the interest they pay to depositors, as a cost of doing business, thereby reducing their tax liability. They have to reduce this interest expense, however, if the bank has invested in tax-exempt bonds. Generally, banks and financial institutions are required to reduce their interest rate expense deduction by the same ratio as tax-exempt bonds have to all assets in their portfolio. The rule is in place to keep banks from benefitting from two tax preferences for the same investment.</p>

<p>Tax-exempt bond investments by individuals and non-financial institutions that comprise less than 2 percent of their investment portfolio, however, are not required to reduce their interest expense deduction. Also, investment by banks in qualified tax-exempt bonds receive more favorable tax treatment. Under this provision, the interest expense deduction is reduced by 20 percent of the interest expense allocable to these bonds. This confers a more favorable treatment on the qualified tax-exempt bonds and is often identified as the ""two percent rule.""</p>

Generally, governments and nonprofit entities would issue the bonds and use the bond proceeds to buy forest land. The FCBs are intended to encourage the purchase and conservation of forest land by governments and nonprofit entities.</p>

<p>Once the bonds are issued, the proceeds must be spent within three years. A unique feature of FCBs is the allowance for an issuer to characterize up to 50 percent of its allocation amount as though it had been a federal tax payment for the previous year. The legislation then provides that the Treasury cannot collect these payments from such entities. Thus, the Treasury is then required to ""refund"" the phantom tax payment (i.e., up to 50 percent of the bond allocation) to the allocatee. This forms the basis of the revenue loss amount for this tax expenditure.<p>

"#","Exclusion of income earned by voluntary employees' beneficiary associations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Associations (VEBAs) provide life insurance, medical, disability, accident, and other welfare benefits to employee members and their dependents and beneficiaries. Most VEBAs are organized as trusts to be legally separate from employers. Provided certain requirements are met, the income earned by a VEBA is exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 501(a) and 501(c)(9). If the requirements are not met however, the income is subject to the unrelated business income tax (UBIT). With some exceptions, income earned by a VEBA used for prefunding retiree health benefits is subject to this tax.</p>

<p>Employer contributions to VEBAs are deductible within limits, while employee contributions are made with after-tax dollars. When distributed, VEBA benefits are taxable income to recipients unless there is a statutory exclusion explicitly pertaining to those kinds of benefits. Thus, accident and health benefits are excludable under Sections 104 and 105, but severance and vacation pay benefits are taxable.</p>

Similarly, tuition reductions for employees of educational institutions and their families are not included in taxable income. From an economic point of view, scholarships and fellowships are either gifts not conditioned on the performance of services, or they are rebates of educational costs. Thus, under the baseline tax system of the reference law method, this exclusion is not a tax expenditure because this method does not include either gifts or price reductions in a taxpayer's gross income. The exclusion, however, is considered a tax expenditure under the normal tax method, which includes gift-like transfers of Government funds in gross income (many scholarships are derived directly or indirectly from Government funding). </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

The credit applies to employees who begin work on or before August 31, 2011 and who are certified as members of various targeted groups. The amount of the credit that can be claimed is 25 percent of qualified wages for employment less than 400 hours and 40 percent for employment of 400 hours or more. Generally, the maximum credit per employee is $2,400 and can only be claimed on the first year of wages an individual earns from an employer. However, the credit for long-term welfare recipients can be claimed on second year wages as well and has a $9,000 maximum. Employees must work at least 120 hours to be eligible for the credit. Employers must reduce their deduction for wages paid by the amount of the credit claimed. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

In contrast, the Tax Code may not tax all of the Social Security benefits that exceed the beneficiary's contributions from previously taxed income. Actuarially, previously taxed contributions generally do not exceed 15 percent of benefits, even for retirees receiving the highest levels of benefits. Up to 85 percent of recipients' Social Security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits are included in (phased into) the income tax base if the recipient's provisional income exceeds certain base amounts. (Provisional income is equal to other items included in adjusted gross income plus foreign or U.S. possession income, tax-exempt interest, and one half of Social Security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits.)

<p>Federal subsidies are available to encourage widespread participation by low-income Medicare beneficiaries, and to prevent large numbers of public and private employers and unions that offer prescription drug benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees from dropping or sharply cutting this coverage.

<p>In 2010 and 2011, the subsidy payments are equal to 28 percent of a qualified retiree's allowable gross prescription drug costs between $310 and $6,300. This means that the maximum subsidy for a qualified retiree in each year is $1,764. Employers who choose to receive subsidy payments are allowed to exclude them from their taxable income under both the regular income tax and the alternative minimum tax. In addition, an employer may disregard any subsidy it receives in calculating its deduction for health benefits for current employees and retirees. For tax years starting on or after January 1, 2013, employers will be required to reduce that deduction by the amount of any subsidy received, subjecting the subsidy to taxation.

"#","Exclusion of Medicare benefits: Supplementary medical insurance (Part B)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>The Medicare program has four main components: Parts A, B, C and D. Part B of Medicare provides supplementary medical insurance (SMI). Among the services covered under Part B are certain physician services, outpatient hospital services, and durable medical equipment.</p> 

<p>Unlike Part A of Medicare, participation in SMI is voluntary. Enrollees must pay a minimum monthly premium that varies over time. The program generally pays for 80 percent of Medicare's fee schedule or other approved amounts after a beneficiary satisfies an annual deductible, which is $155 in 2010. Premiums are set to cover 25 percent of the program's estimated costs for most recipients; the remaining 75 percent is funded out of general revenues.</p>

<p>Transfers from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury to pay for the cost of covered services are excluded from the taxable income of enrollees.</p>
