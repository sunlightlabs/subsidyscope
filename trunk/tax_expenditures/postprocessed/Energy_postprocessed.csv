Losses are limited in an attempt to limit tax sheltering activities. Passive losses that are unused may be carried forward and applied against future passive income. </p><p>In contrast to the general restrictions on passive losses, the Tax Code exempts owners of working interests in oil and gas properties from passive income limitations such that the working interest-holder who manages the development of wells and incurs all operating costs on behalf of himself and all other owners may aggregate negative taxable income (i.e. losses) from such interests with his other income.

#,"Excess of percentage over cost depletion, fuels",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>The baseline tax system would allow recovery of the costs of developing certain oil and mineral properties using cost depletion. Cost depletion is similar in concept to depreciation, in that the costs of developing or acquiring the asset are capitalized and then gradually reduced over an estimate of the asset's productive life, as is appropriate for measuring net income. </p><p>In contrast, the Tax Code generally allows independent fuel and mineral producers and royalty owners to take percentage depletion deductions rather than cost depletion on limited quantities of output. Under percentage depletion, taxpayers deduct a percentage of gross income from mineral production. In certain cases the deduction is limited to a fraction of the asset's net income. Over the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost of the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion offers more generous tax treatment than would cost depletion, which would limit deductions to an investment's cost. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/spec.pdf""><em>Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2011</em>.</a>"

This insures that the net income from the well is measured appropriately each year. </p><p>In contrast to this treatment, current law allows intangible drilling costs for successful investments in domestic oil and gas wells (such as wages, the cost of using machinery for grading and drilling, and the cost of unsalvageable materials used in constructing wells) to be deducted immediately, i.e., expensed. Because it allows recovery of costs sooner, expensing is more generous for the taxpayer than would be amortization. Integrated oil companies may deduct only 70 percent of such costs and must amortize the remaining 30 percent over five years. The same rule applies to the exploration and development costs of surface stripping and the construction of shafts and tunnels for other fuel minerals. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/spec.pdf""><em>Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2011</em>.</a>"
