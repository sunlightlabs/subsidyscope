The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, current law allows capital gains to be taxed at a preferentially low rate that is no higher than 15 percent. Certain agricultural income, such as unharvested crops, qualify for taxation as capital gains rather than ordinary income, and so benefit from the preferentially low 15 percent maximum tax rate on capital gains. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/spec.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2011.</a>"
