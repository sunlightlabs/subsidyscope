Instead, taxpayers can receive a refundable tax credit for qualified adoption expenses under current law. The maximum credit is $13,170 per child for 2010, and is phased-out ratably for taxpayers with modified AGI between $182,520 and $222,520. The credit amounts and the phase-out thresholds are indexed for inflation.

"#","Exclusion of income earned by voluntary employees' beneficiary associations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Associations (VEBAs) provide life insurance, medical, disability, accident, and other welfare benefits to employee members and their dependents and beneficiaries. Most VEBAs are organized as trusts to be legally separate from employers. Provided certain requirements are met, the income earned by a VEBA is exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 501(a) and 501(c)(9). If the requirements are not met however, the income is subject to the unrelated business income tax (UBIT). With some exceptions, income earned by a VEBA used for prefunding retiree health benefits is subject to this tax.</p>

<p>Employer contributions to VEBAs are deductible within limits, while employee contributions are made with after-tax dollars. When distributed, VEBA benefits are taxable income to recipients unless there is a statutory exclusion explicitly pertaining to those kinds of benefits. Thus, accident and health benefits are excludable under Sections 104 and 105, but severance and vacation pay benefits are taxable.</p>

The latter enable payments to be made on behalf of beneficiaries into a variety of investment vehicles offered by plan sponsors (e.g., age-based portfolios whose mix of stocks and bonds changes the closer the beneficiarys matriculation date or an option with a guaranteed rate of return); the balances in college savings accounts can be applied toward a panoply of qualified higher education expenses (e.g., tuition and fees, books, supplies, room and board, and special needs services).
