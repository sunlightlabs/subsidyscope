#,Build America bonds ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>In the 111th Congress, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5, ARRA) created a new type of tax credit bond, the Build America Bond, which allows issuers the option of receiving a direct payment from the U.S. Treasury or tax credits for investors instead of tax-exempt interest payments.</p> 

<p>Build America Bonds are not targeted in their designation as are other tax credit bonds (TCBs, such as qualified zone academy bonds, qualified school construction bonds, and clean renewable energy bonds). The volume is not limited and the purpose is constrained only by the requirement that the interest on such obligation would (but for this section) be excludible from gross income under section 103. Thus, Build America Bonds can be issued for any purpose that would have been eligible for traditional tax-exempt bond financing other than private activity bonds. The bonds must be issued before January 1, 2011.</p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the Treasury tax expenditure ""Build America Bonds"" found in the General Purpose Fiscal Assistance Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>

#,Eliminate requirement that financial institutions allocate interest expense attributable to tax-exempt interest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>In the 111th Congress, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5, ARRA) created new rules for banks (and other financial institutions) that invest in tax-exempt bonds. Banks deduct interest expense, the interest they pay to depositors, as a cost of doing business, thereby reducing their tax liability. They have to reduce this interest expense, however, if the bank has invested in tax-exempt bonds. Generally, banks and financial institutions are required to reduce their interest rate expense deduction by the same ratio as tax-exempt bonds have to all assets in their portfolio. The rule is in place to keep banks from benefitting from two tax preferences for the same investment.</p>

<p>Tax-exempt bond investments by individuals and non-financial institutions that comprise less than 2 percent of their investment portfolio, however, are not required to reduce their interest expense deduction. Also, investment by banks in qualified tax-exempt bonds receive more favorable tax treatment. Under this provision, the interest expense deduction is reduced by 20 percent of the interest expense allocable to these bonds. This confers a more favorable treatment on the qualified tax-exempt bonds and is often identified as the two percent rule.</p>
