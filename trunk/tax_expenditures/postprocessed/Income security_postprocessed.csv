#,Earned income tax credit  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Earned income tax credit (EITC).&mdash;The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific group. In contrast, the Tax Code provides an EITC to low-income workers at a maximum rate of 40 percent of income. For a family with one qualifying child, the credit is 34 percent of the first $8,950 of earned income in 2009. The credit is 40 percent of the first $12,570 of income for a family with two or more qualifying children. The credit is 45 percent of the first $12,570 of income for a family with three or more qualifying children. Low-income workers with no qualifying children are eligible for a 7.65 percent credit on the first $5,970 of earned income. The credit is phased out at income levels and rates which depend upon how many qualifying children are eligible and marital status. Earned income tax credits in excess of tax liabilities owed through the individual income tax system are refundable to individuals. </p>",
