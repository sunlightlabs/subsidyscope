#,Social Security benefits for retired workers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. In contrast, the Tax Code may not tax all of the Social Security benefits that exceed the beneficiary's contributions out of taxed income. These additional retirement benefits are paid for partly by employers' contributions that were not included in employees' taxable compensation and partly by earnings on employee and employer contributions. Portions of benefits (reaching as much as 85 percent) of recipients' Social Security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits are included in (phasedin) the income tax base, however, if the recipient's provisional income exceeds certain base amounts. Provisional income is equal to adjusted gross income plus foreign or U.S. possession income and tax-exempt interest, and one half of Social Security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits. The tax expenditure is limited to the portion of the benefits received by taxpayers who are below the income amounts at which 85 percent of the benefits are taxable. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"
