In contrast, under current law individual taxpayers can take advantage of traditional and Roth IRAs to defer or otherwise reduce the tax on the return to their retirement savings. The IRA contribution limit is $5,000 in 2010 (indexed); taxpayers age 50 or over are allowed to make additional ""catch-up'' contributions of $1,000. Contributions to a traditional IRA are generally deductible but the deduction is phased out for workers with incomes above certain levels who, or whose spouses, are active participants in an employer-provided retirement plan. Contributions and account earnings are includible in income when withdrawn from traditional IRAs. Individuals who make nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA can still benefit from deferral of tax on earnings. Roth IRA contributions are not deductible, but earnings and withdrawals are exempt from taxation under certain conditions. Income limits also apply to Roth IRA contributions; however, taxpayers at any income level may roll account balances from traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs, after paying income tax on any deduction and accrued income. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income.

They are not included in the employees' gross income for tax purposes, however, until they are paid out as benefits. In addition, the following special income tax provisions for ESOPs are intended to increase ownership of corporations by their employees: (1) annual employer contributions are subject to less restrictive limitations than other qualified retirement plans; (2) ESOPs may borrow to purchase employer stock, guaranteed by their agreement with the employer that the debt will be serviced by his payment (deductible by him) of a portion of wages (excludable by the employees) to service the loan; (3) employees who sell appreciated company stock to the ESOP may defer any taxes due until they withdraw benefits; and (4) dividends paid to ESOP-held stock are deductible by the employer. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the JCT tax expenditure ""Special tax provisions for employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs),"" found in the 'education, training, employment, and social services' budget function and available <a href=""/tax_expenditures/db/group/345/?estimate=3"">here</a>.</p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

In contrast, the Tax Code allows taxpayers who are 65 years of age or older, or who are permanently disabled, to claim a tax credit equal to 15 percent of the sum of their earned and retirement income. The amount to which the 15 percent rate is applied is limited to no more than $5,000 for single individuals or married couples filing a joint return where only one spouse is 65 years of age or older, and up to $7,500 for joint returns where both spouses are 65 years of age or older. These limits are reduced by one-half of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income over $7,500 for single individuals and $10,000 for married couples filing a joint return. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"
