#,High-speed intercity rail vehicle speed requirement for exempt high-speed rail facility bonds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, P.L. 100-647, enacted on November 10, 1988, created a new class of tax-exempt, qualified private activity bonds for the financing of high-speed intercity rail projects. Seventy-five percent of the bonds issued for high-speed rail projects are exempt from the federally imposed annual state volume cap on private activity bonds. This cap is equal to the greater of $90 per capita or $273.775 million in 2010. </p>

<p>Before enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5), qualified projects must have used vehicles that were reasonably expected to operate at speeds in excess of 150 miles per hour. This tax expenditure is for the change in the law that occurred with the enactment of the ARRA. Now, under current law, high-speed rail projects will qualify if vehicles are capable of traveling at 150 miles per hour.</p>
