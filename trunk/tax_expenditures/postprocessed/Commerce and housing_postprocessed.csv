#,15-year recovery period for retail motor fuels outlets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Taxpayers are allowed to deduct the costs of acquiring depreciable assets (assets that wear out or become obsolete over a period of years) as depreciation deductions. The tax code currently allows new buildings other than rental housing to be written off over 39 years, using a straight line method where equal amounts are deducted in each period. There is also a prescribed 40 year write-off period for these buildings under the alternative minimum tax (also based on a straight-line method).</p>

<p>Motorsports complexes (tracks and other land improvements and support facilities) are depreciated over seven years using a double declining balance method (where a rate twice as large as straight line is applied to the undepreciated balance, with a switch to straight line midway through the period). About half the revenue cost is due to the special provisions, primarily the treatment of leasehold improvements. These provisions are included in the extenders provisions, which are usually extended each year.</p>

The credit is allowed in equal amounts over 10 years and is generally subject to a volume cap. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/spec.pdf""><em>Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2011</em>.</a>"

It would not allow the deductibility of expenses when income or the return on investments are not taxed. In contrast, the Tax Code provides that owner-occupants of homes may deduct mortgage interest on their primary and secondary residences as itemized nonbusiness deductions even though the value of owneroccupied housing services is not included in a taxpayer's taxable income. In general, the mortgage interest deduction is limited to interest on debt no greater than the owner's basis in the residence, and is also limited to interest on debt of no more than $1 million. Interest on up to $100,000 of other debt secured by a lien on a principal or second residence is also deductible, irrespective of the purpose of borrowing, provided the debt does not exceed the fair market value of the residence. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/spec.pdf""><em>Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2011</em>.</a>"

It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates, or deferral of tax, to apply to certain types or sources of income. Dealers in real and personal property (i.e., sellers who regularly hold property for sale or resale) cannot defer taxable income from installment sales until the receipt of the loan repayment. Nondealers (i.e., sellers of real property used in their business) are required to pay interest on deferred taxes attributable to their total installment obligations in excess of $5 million. Only properties with sales prices exceeding $150,000 are includable in the total. The payment of a market rate of interest eliminates the benefit of the tax deferral. The tax exemption for nondealers with total installment obligations of less than $5 million is, therefore, a tax expenditure. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/spec.pdf""><em>Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2011</em>.</a>"

#,Exception from net operating loss limitations for corporations in bankruptcy proceedings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>In general, net operating losses of corporations may be carried back three years or carried forward fifteen years to offset taxable income in those years. If one corporation acquires another, the tax code has rules to determine whether the acquiring corporation inherits the tax attributes of the acquired corporation, including its net operating loss carryforwards, or whether the tax attributes of the acquired corporation disappear.</p>

<p>If certain conditions are met, subsection 382(l)(5) provides an exception to the general limitation on net operating loss carryforwards for cases in which the acquired corporation was in bankruptcy proceedings at the time of the acquisition. In this case (unless the corporation elects otherwise), the limitation on net operating loss carryforwards does not apply. In some cases, however, certain adjustments are made to the amount of loss carryforwards of the acquired corporation that may be used by the successor corporation.</p>

#,Exclusion of gain or loss on sale or exchange of brownfield property,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Tax exempt organizations are subject to tax under the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) for activities that are not part of their tax exempt purpose. Gains on the sale of property are not generally taxed unless the property is inventory or stock in trade.

#,Exclusion of interest on life insurance savings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Deferral of income on life insurance and annuity contracts.&mdash;Under the baseline tax system, individuals and corporations pay taxes on their income when it is (actually or constructively) received or accrued, depending on their method of accounting. Nevertheless, the Tax Code provides favorable tax treatment for investment income earned within qualified life insurance and annuity contracts. In general, investment income earned on qualified life insurance contracts held until death is permanently exempt from income tax. Investment income distributed prior to the death of the insured is generally tax-deferred. Investment income earned on annuities benefits from tax deferral. </p>",

Depreciable property financed with small issue IDBs must be depreciated, however, using the straight-line method. The annual volume of small issue IDBs is subject to the unified volume cap discussed in the mortgage housing bond section above. </p>",

#,Exclusion of interest spread of financial institutions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Exclusion of interest spread of financial institutions.&mdash;The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Consumers and nonprofit organizations pay for some deposit-linked services, such as check cashing, by accepting a below-market interest rate on their demand deposits. If they received a market rate of interest on those deposits and paid explicit fees for the associated services, they would pay taxes on the full market rate and (unlike businesses) could not deduct the fees. The Government thus foregoes tax on the difference between the risk-free market interest rate and below-market interest rates on demand deposits, which under competitive conditions should equal the value added of deposit services. </p>",

Section 108(i) allowed financially troubled companies to defer their taxable cancellation of indebtedness income in certain circumstances.</p> <p>Section 108(i) permits a taxpayer to elect to defer income from cancellation of indebtedness recognized by the taxpayer as a result of a repurchase by the taxpayer or a person who bears a relationship to the taxpayer, of a debt instrument that was issued by the taxpayer. Section 108(i) applies only to repurchases of debt that occur after December 31, 2008, and prior to January 1, 2011, and are repurchases for cash. A debt instrument is broadly defined to include any bond, debenture, note, certificate or any other instrument or contractual arrangement constituting indebtedness.</p>

#,Income recognition rule for gain or loss from section 1256 contracts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>A Section 1256 contract is any regulated futures contract, foreign currency contract, nonequity option, dealer equity option, or dealer securities futures contract that is traded on a qualified board of exchange with a mark-to-market accounting system. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203) clarified that section 1256 does not apply to certain derivatives contracts (e.g., credit default swaps). Under this mark-to-market rule, the gains and losses must be reported on an annual basis, for tax purposes. </p>

<p>The capital gain or loss of applicable contracts are treated as consisting of 40 percent short-term and 60 percent long-term gain or loss. This is true regardless of how long the contract is held. The 60/40 rule does not apply to hedging transactions or limited partnerships. A hedging transaction is a transaction done by a business in its normal operation with the primary purpose of reducing certain risks.</p>

#,Interest rate and discounting period assumptions for reserves of property and casualty insurance companies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>The way in which the present values of future losses for property and casualty insurance companies are calculated may provide those insurers with a tax advantage. A present value is the current equivalent value of a given cash flow and is calculated using interest rates or discount factors and information about the timing of income and losses. Most businesses calculate taxable income by deducting expenses when the business becomes liable for paying them. A significant portion of losses paid by property and casualty insurance companies are paid years after premiums were collected. Funds that an insurer holds between payment of premiums and disbursement of loss claims are known as float and investment earnings on those funds are an important source of revenue in some lines of insurance.</p>

<p>State regulators typically require insurers to maintain minimum levels of loss reserves to ensure solvency, that is, the ability to pay all future claims. On the other hand, if loss reserves are well above levels needed to ensure solvency, an insurer may be able to shift current earnings into future years, thus deferring tax payments. In other words, some form of discounting is appropriate to ensure that premium income, received when a policy is written, is properly matched with associated losses that occur later. If losses in future years are not fully discounted, the insurer may enjoy a tax advantage through the ability to defer loss payments. </p>

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) imposed the 15 percent pro-ration provision, as Congress held that using tax-exempt investments to finance additions to loss reserves was inappropriate. Therefore, the allowable deduction for additions to loss reserves was reduced to 15 percent of (I) the insurers tax-exempt interest, (ii) the deductible portion of dividends received (with special rules for dividends from affiliates), and (iii) the increase for the taxable year in the cash value of life insurance, endowment or annuity contracts.</p>","Description adapted from <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-111SPRT62799/pdf/CPRT-111SPRT62799.pdf""><em>Tax Expenditures: Compendium of Background Materials on Individual Provisions</em></a>, Congressional Research Service, December 2010, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office."

<p>The Blue Cross and Blue Shield special deduction has two main features. First, eligible health insurers are treated in the tax law as stock property and casualty insurance companies. Eligible organizations, however, can fully deduct unearned premiums, unlike other property and casualty insurance companies. Second, eligible companies may take a special deduction of 25 percent of the years health-related claims and expenses minus its accumulated surplus at the beginning of the year (if such claims and expenses exceed the accumulated surplus). The special deduction is also known as the three-month deduction because when an eligible insurers health-related claims and expenses exceed its accumulated surplus, it may deduct a quarter of the difference for the year. </p><p>This tax expenditure corresponds with the Treasury tax expenditure Special Blue Cross/Blue Shield deduction,"" found in the Health Budget Function and available <a href="""">LINK HERE</a>.</p>

#,Surtax on unearned income,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>This provision imposes a 3.8-percent unearned income Medicare
contribution tax on the lesser of net investment income or the excess of modified adjusted gross income over the threshold amount of an individual. The threshold amount is $250,000 in the case of a joint return or surviving spouse, $125,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return, and $200,000 in any
other case. In the case of an estate or trust, the tax is 3.8 percent of the lesser of undistributed net investment income or the excess of adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an estate or trust begins. As the provision raises revenue, this special rate of tax represents
a negative tax expenditure over the 2010-2014 time period.</p>

#,Tax exemption of certain insurance companies owned by tax-exempt organizations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Insurance companies owned by exempt organizations.&mdash;Under the baseline tax system, corporations pay taxes on their profits under the regular tax rate schedule.

Insurance operations conducted by such exempt organizations as fraternal societies, voluntary employee benefit associations, and others, however, are exempt from tax. </p>",
