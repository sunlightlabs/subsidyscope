In contrast, certain active income of foreign corporations controlled by U.S. shareholders is not subject to U.S. taxation when it is earned. The income becomes taxable only when the controlling U.S. shareholders receive dividends or other distributions from their foreign stockholding. The reference law tax baseline reflects this tax treatment where only realized income is taxed. Under the normal tax method, however, the currently attributable foreign source pre-tax income from such a controlling interest is considered to be subject to U.S. taxation, whether or not distributed. Thus, the normal tax method considers the amount of controlled foreign corporation income not yet distributed to a U.S. shareholder as tax-deferred income. </p>","Description from <a href=""http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-PER.pdf"">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2012.</a>"

In contrast to this treatment, U.S. tax law allows U.S. citizens who live abroad, work in the private sector, and satisfy a foreign residency requirement to exclude up to $80,000 in foreign earned income from U.S. taxes. In addition, if these taxpayers receive a specific allowance for foreign housing from their employers, then they may also exclude the value of that allowance.

The parent company pays the IC-DISC a tax deductible commission attributable to qualified export sales. Because the IC-DISC pays no tax, distributions (actual or ""deemed"") to IC-DISC shareholders are taxed only once, often at the lower individual dividend and capital gains tax rates. As a result, the after tax return to shareholders is enhanced.</p>

<p>IC-DISC shareholders may defer up to $10 million that is attributable to qualified export sales. An interest charge is imposed on shareholders, however, based on the distribution that would have occurred had deferral not been elected.
