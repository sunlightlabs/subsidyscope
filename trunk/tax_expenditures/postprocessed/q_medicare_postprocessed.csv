"#","Exclusion of certain subsidies to employers who maintain prescription drug plans for Medicare enrollees","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>The Medicare program has four components: Parts A , B, C, and D. Part D offers a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit that began on January 1, 2006. Every individual enrolled in Medicare Parts A or B, or who receives Medicare benefits through a private health plan under Part C, is eligible to enroll in a qualified prescription drug plan. </p>
<p>Federal subsidies are available to encourage widespread participation by low-income Medicare beneficiaries, and to prevent large numbers of public and private employers and unions that offer prescription drug benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees from dropping or sharply cutting this coverage. Public and private employers and unions electing the subsidy payments must agree to subject their drug benefits for retirees to continuing federal scrutiny. </p>
<p>In 2010 and 2011, the subsidy payments are equal to 28 percent of a qualified retiree's allowable gross prescription drug costs between $310 and $6,300. This means that the maximum subsidy for a qualified retiree in each year is $1,764. Employers who choose to receive subsidy payments are allowed to exclude them from their taxable income under both the regular income tax and the alternative minimum tax. In addition, an employer may disregard any subsidy it receives in calculating its deduction for health benefits for current employees and retirees. For tax years starting on or after January 1, 2013, employers will be required to reduce that deduction by the amount of any subsidy received, subjecting the subsidy to taxation.

<p>Medicare Part A is financed primarily by a payroll tax levied on the earnings of current workers. The tax rate is 2.90 percent, and there is no ceiling on the earnings subject to the tax. Self-employed individuals pay the full rate, while employees and employers each pay 1.45 percent. The employer's share of the payroll tax is excluded from an employee's taxable income. Moreover, the expected lifetime value of Part A benefits under current law exceeds the amount of payroll tax contributions by current beneficiaries. These excess benefits are excluded from the taxable income of Medicare Part A beneficiaries.</p>
